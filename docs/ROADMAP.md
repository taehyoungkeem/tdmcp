# tdmcp Roadmap

tdmcp connects an AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, Codex…) to TouchDesigner so you
can build real visual systems from plain language — no node-wiring by hand. This
page is the honest, bird's-eye picture of **what already works, what's still
rough, and what's coming next** on the way to a stable 1.0.

**Where things stand today.** The published npm `latest` package and latest
published GitHub Release/tag are **v0.13.1** (published 2026-07-09). That release
contains the tool-integration campaign and native RayTK graph work described
below. Local HEAD `fd7282ed` is three commits after the released tag and matches
`main` / `origin/main`; the TD-native discovery Waves 1–16 are additional dirty
worktree changes on top of that HEAD. They are **unreleased**, are not present in
npm or the `v0.13.1` tag, and keep their live evidence boundaries explicit. The
CHANGELOG blocks list every entry; the always-current tool list is the
[Tools reference](/reference/tools). 1.0 is **not** the next minor — the v0.1x
line is the active feature/consolidation line, and v1.0 will land only once the
consolidation gates below are all green.

The project has grown through five arcs:

1. **Generate** — one-line tools that build a whole wired network (audio-reactive,
   generative, feedback, 3D, particles, shaders).
2. **Perform** — turn those networks into playable instruments (cues, macros,
   control surfaces, a phone remote, beat sync, a hands-free auto-VJ).
3. **Package & operate** — reusable components, project analysis, token-cheap
   editing primitives, and a structured bridge that keeps working in a
   locked-down venue.
4. **Compose & automate** *(v0.7.0)* — run a whole
   arranged show over time, with timelines, setlists, schedulers, cue composition
   and live-safety controls.
5. **Ingest & extend** *(v0.7.x through v0.8.x)* — pull
   in the wider TouchDesigner world (Shadertoy / ISF shaders, Ableton, the
   iconic VJ looks), then deepen AI/library publishing and operator DX. Waves
   1-3 are in v0.7.0; v0.7.1 ships the first CLI/copilot/resource/bridge
   follow-through; v0.8.1 closes the current generator, MediaPipe, session
   profile, dashboard, inline-preview and resilience queue.

## ✅ Current Release Line

### v0.13.1 public baseline + post-release source-tree campaign

**v0.13.1 is public** on npm, GitHub Releases and the annotated release tag.
The RayTK/tool-integration entries in this section belong to that release. Local
HEAD `fd7282ed` contains three later mainline commits; the TD-native Waves 1–16
listed here are newer dirty-worktree work and remain **unreleased**:

- **Native RayTK integration.** `create_raytk_op`, `create_raytk_scene`, and the
  `tdmcp://raytk/operators` catalog drive RayTK (t3kt/raytk) as editable ROP
  node graphs, complementary to the GLSL raymarch tools.
- **RayTK version-gate honesty.** `manage_packages doctor raytk` now reflects
  RayTK 0.46's TD 2025.30770+ requirement and warns on older TouchDesigner
  builds.
- **Registry/directory fixes.** Glama/MCP directory metadata exposes
  `TDMCP_TOOL_PROFILE`, and the Creative RAG Smithsonian adapter now produces a
  valid canonical URL when `record_link` is absent.
- **TD-native Interaction & Safety Wave 1 (source tree, unreleased).** A bounded
  native broker now gates delete and Save As overwrite decisions; structured
  editor context, project save, Pulse, atomic node metadata edits and node
  placement work without `/api/exec`. Offline contracts and regression suites
  are covered; live inbox, delete, Save/Save As, Pulse, editor context and
  placement passed on TD 099 build 2025.32820. An actual headless process and
  other builds remain **UNVERIFIED**. Live undo/redo probing passed for ordinary
  nested edits but reproduced an `annotateCOMP` that closes/replaces the outer
  block, so whole-tool undo stays disabled. Wave 8 later also rejects automated
  one-item undo because the native stack has no stable item identity.
- **Build-aware Agent Enablement & Runtime Readiness Wave 2 (source tree,
  unreleased).** `get_td_docs` reads bounded installed OfflineHelp with embedded
  fallback and honest build provenance; `manage_agent_skills` and `tdmcp skills`
  manage only three package-bundled, manifest-owned Codex/Claude skills with
  dry-run and rollback; the maintainer bundle is deterministic and local-only;
  `tdmcp status` reports redacted config, bridge, TD, interaction, skill and
  client readiness. The installed macOS TD 2025.32820 corpus passed offline/real-
  corpus tests; bridge-live and Windows discovery remain **UNVERIFIED**.
- **Project-scoped Ownership & Reversible Setup Wave 3 (source tree,
  unreleased).** Package and local-library installs now have explicit user or
  project ownership; client setup can plan, check, reconcile, or remove only a
  named Claude Code/Cursor project/user or Codex user registration with atomic
  verification and secret redaction. `tdmcp status` observes those native
  targets, bare `tdmcp doctor` owns environment diagnostics, and package doctor
  lives under `tdmcp packages doctor`. Codex project scope remains intentionally
  unsupported pending a verified client contract; live package import remains
  **UNVERIFIED**. Wave 7 later proves package namespace classification/dry-run on
  the current build while keeping final cross-storage apply unverified.
- **Grounded, Verified & Calibrated Local Copilot Wave 4 (source tree,
  unreleased).** Local turns use ephemeral bounded editor context, canonical
  registered prompts are locally invocable through schema validation, supported
  mutations carry post-dispatch read-only evidence, and one bounded adaptive
  recovery action never retries an ambiguous mutation. `tdmcp
  copilot-calibrate` evaluates only synthetic fixture tools and caches decisions
  by exact redacted model-build identity; advisory `recommend` remains the
  default, while `enforce` fails closed to `safe` without fresh exact evidence.
  TouchDesigner-live grounding/verification remains **UNVERIFIED — pending a
  safe bridge**. Wave 13 later passed exact synthetic real-model calibration,
  including native vision capability and image input; the separate visual-
  critique rubric and TD-fixture gate remains FAIL/UNVERIFIED.
- **Project-Owned Context & Auditable Copilot Turns Wave 5 (source tree,
  unreleased).** Each project can own a bounded, versioned agent brief at
  `.tdmcp/agent-brief.json`, selected only by explicit root, environment, or the
  saved TouchDesigner project folder and replaced with an exact revision. The
  local copilot uses it as ephemeral untrusted evidence; external MCP hosts read
  `tdmcp://project/brief` explicitly. Ask, browser/headless chat and Telegram now
  finalize one redacted structured receipt on success, failure, cancellation or
  max steps. Optional private persistence is capped by count, age and bytes and
  is suppressed for perform mode, emergency tools and `noPersist`; receipts are
  readable through a bounded MCP resource. Live root inference and live mutation
  evidence remain **UNVERIFIED — pending bridge/model endpoint**.
- **Bounded Live Project Discovery Wave 6 (source tree, unreleased).**
  `find_td_nodes` now prefers compact authenticated bridge-side traversal with
  legacy-call compatibility and an older-bridge structured fallback.
  `find_td_parameters` adds bounded point-in-time filters for parameter name,
  value, expression, mode and non-default state with deterministic ordering,
  secret redaction, anti-oracle behavior and unreadable counters. Both passed
  live auth, `ALLOW_EXEC=0`, limit, completeness and undo-stack checks on TD 099
  build 2025.32820; other builds remain unverified until probed.
- **Action-aware, Transactional Editor Workflows Wave 7 (source tree,
  unreleased).** Existing tools now provide action/framing-aware Network Editor
  follow, broker-aware atomic `.tox` export, dry-run-first package namespace
  reconciliation and transactional custom-parameter lifecycle without duplicate
  aliases. The new `insert_operator_at_selection` adds a context-CAS, explicitly
  placed, rollback-safe single-edge insertion primitive. Current-build live
  evidence passed the six-frame follow route; `as_is`/`portable` TOX save,
  verification, restoration and induced failure; package ownership
  classification/dry-run; promoted Page/Par lifecycle primitives; and direct
  connector insertion with one-item undo/redo. Final integrated offline suites
  pass. Wave 8 later closes authenticated route-level insertion, TOX overwrite
  and response-loss recovery, package apply, and custom-parameter rollback on
  the same build. Actual headless TD and other builds remain **UNVERIFIED**;
  colour highlight and public custom-parameter EXPORT mode are **HELD**.
- **Wave 7 undo boundary and local plugin diagnosis.** A real multi-request
  probe is **FAIL** for one native undo block across a complete MCP tool: TD
  terminates dangling blocks when each Web Server DAT callback returns. Keep one
  undo block per mutating REST request and hold whole-tool scope until a bounded
  one-request plan/journal design passes. The workstation's macOS plugin alert
  is a separate local trust **FAIL**: the TouchDesigner app seal is invalid and
  FreenectTOP is ad-hoc signed/Gatekeeper-rejected; registration/cooking remains
  **UNVERIFIED**, with no security or install-state workaround applied.
- **Live Closure & Native History Safety Wave 8 (source tree, unreleased).** A
  fresh authenticated TD 099 build 2025.32820 sandbox with bridge exec disabled
  passed the final insert, TOX export, package reconciliation and custom-
  parameter route matrices, including retries, cancellation, rollback, cleanup
  and applicable native undo/redo checks. Mutation receipts distinguish the
  actual TD item name from the requested bridge wrapper. Public automated
  one-item undo was rejected because stack items are repeatable plain strings
  and cannot prevent same-label ABA; whole-tool cross-request undo also remains
  **FAIL / HELD**.
- **Portable Artifact Trust & Annotation-Aware Composition Wave 9 (source tree,
  unreleased).** Existing library and editor tools now provide quarantine-only
  deep TOX round-trip validation, canonical automatic provenance, optional
  installed exact-build component help, transactional Annotate COMP style/bounds
  editing and fingerprinted annotation-aware layout. The authenticated TD 099
  build 2025.32820 sandbox passed exact edit/readback/rollback, stale-layout
  rejection and deterministic repeat, portable artifact/provenance idempotency,
  dirty-Git preflight refusal, exact-build help attachment, post-attach round-
  trip and scratch cleanup with bridge exec disabled. No duplicate public tools
  or raw-Python shortcuts were introduced; actual headless TD and other builds
  remain **UNVERIFIED**.
- **Artist Workspace Control & Exact Placement Wave 10 (source tree,
  unreleased).** The existing `arrange_network` surface now accepts a bounded
  `layout_mode: "explicit"` branch with exact coordinates, dock-host precedence,
  context fingerprints, idempotent replay and complete one-request rollback;
  legacy automatic and annotation-aware behavior remains the default. The new
  `manage_artist_workspace` surface owns one temporary Network Editor plus
  TOP/PANEL viewer split, schedules all TouchDesigner UI work on later frames,
  retains only scalar state and restores only an unchanged bridge-owned layout.
  Integrated offline route, client, state-machine, rollback, auth and
  `ALLOW_EXEC=0` contracts pass. Authenticated TD 099 build 2025.32820 QA passed
  explicit placement apply/replay/undo/redo; TOP workspace
  scheduled/active/restored; PANEL workspace scheduled/active/cancelled; exact
  cleanup; null workspace undo labels; auth refusal and input bounds. The first
  three-readback workspace attempt safely compensated before viewport settling;
  12 readbacks then exposed later drift from animated Network Editor `home()`.
  The final implementation removes that unnecessary animation, retains bounded
  stable readback and passed a fresh TOP restore whose viewport remained at the
  baseline one second later. Terminal no-op keys did not grow retained
  idempotency state, and no new `THREAD CONFLICT` appeared. Live conflict,
  timeout/lease/Perform edges, Windows, TouchPlayer, floating-pane variants,
  actual headless TD and other builds remain **UNVERIFIED**. Wave 13 installed
  and exactly calibrated `qwen3-vl:8b-instruct-q4_K_M`: native Ollama metadata
  proves `vision`, hardened suite `2026-07-15.3` passes every tool gate plus
  `image_input`, and the exact cache is mutation-eligible. Its strict offline
  good/bad surrogate also passes 6/6 with local scores 91 versus 43 and unchanged
  thresholds. Wave 14 then integrated the bounded optional
  `enhance_build.visualCritique` path and authenticated inspect/commit/restore
  routes. Exact-model live QA then passed preview, native Apply, CAS commit and
  readback plus a separate capability-bound restore. Invalid model shape and
  timeout/Keep remained zero-write fail-closed paths; other models/builds and
  actual headless TD remain **UNVERIFIED**.
- **Remote Connection Trust Wave 11 (source tree, unreleased).** Streamable HTTP
  can opt into a co-located OAuth authorization-code flow with required S256
  PKCE, exact MCP resource/scope binding, path-specific protected-resource
  metadata, bounded public-client DCR, rotating refresh tokens and per-principal
  MCP session binding. The Node process owns codes/tokens; TouchDesigner only
  shows and consumes a bounded **Allow / Deny** interaction, with every unsafe
  terminal state resolving to Deny and no dependency on `/api/exec`. Legacy HTTP
  behavior remains compatible through `auto`, while mixed legacy bearer access
  requires explicit `hybrid` and invalid combinations fail startup. Offline
  authorization, storage, consent, TD-client, bridge-route and complete HTTP MCP
  integration tests pass. Wave 14 live-proved the TD callback transport for
  Allow, Deny, timeout, close and disconnect with bridge exec disabled. A
  physical pointer click, production HTTPS, actual headless behavior, CIMD and
  multi-user/federated deployments remain **UNVERIFIED / follow-up**, not
  implied by this local single-owner design.

- **Grounded Planning, Show Gate & Internal Transaction Foundation Wave 12
  (source tree, unreleased).** The existing read-only `plan_visual` tool now has
  an explicit `planner: "llm"` option for one bounded completion grounded in
  compact redacted editor, project-brief, graph, recipe, operator and registered-
  tool evidence. The deterministic planner remains the default and typed
  fallback, and all proposed identifiers are validated before the plan is
  returned. `tdmcp show <profile>` is implemented in the source tree as an exact-
  profile runtime-status → doctor → preflight → Perform readback gate with
  dry-run, JSON, separate WARN/UNVERIFIED acceptance and one bounded rollback;
  it never loads a project or uses raw Python. Wave 14 live QA on TD 2025.32820
  passed Perform entry, already-on idempotency and ambiguous-readback rollback;
  other builds and actual headless TD remain **UNVERIFIED**. OAuth DCR now
  prunes tokenless clients after a seven-day default inactivity lifetime,
  evicts the oldest tokenless row at capacity while retaining live-token owners,
  and uses a continuously refilling global registration bucket. Wave 14 adds
  bounded trusted-proxy source identity and per-source buckets under a separate
  global ceiling. An internal, unregistered
  operation-plan core now covers bounded preview/commit validation, commit-time
  CAS, callback journaling and rollback invariants, but fails closed with
  `unverified_live_boundary` without a live-verified adapter. No public route,
  tool or whole-tool undo claim was added.

- **Vision Proof & Internal Transaction Hardening Wave 13 (source tree,
  unreleased).** The explicitly approved exact-digest local vision model passed
  hardened calibration suite `2026-07-15.3`, all tool gates and `image_input`.
  The revised strict offline good/bad surrogate passed 6/6 with locally derived
  scores and unchanged thresholds; authenticated TD-generated fixtures remain
  UNVERIFIED, so no visual mutation surface was built. The internal operation-
  plan foundation now derives exact parameter, metadata and connector CAS state,
  simulates ordered edge changes, bounds build/project/owner identities, aligns
  UTF-8 byte caps across the bridge and rejects incomplete or incoherent terminal
  receipts. Wave 14 live-proved its internal adapter for commit, one callback
  journal entry, native undo/redo and reverse rollback after an induced partial
  failure. It remains unregistered; no whole-operation default or public route
  is claimed.

- **Live Closure & Boundary Hardening Wave 14 (source tree, unreleased).** A
  disposable authenticated TD 099 build 2025.32820 passed show-mode entry,
  already-on behavior and fail-closed rollback; OAuth callback Allow/Deny,
  timeout, close and disconnect; the internal operation adapter's
  commit/undo/redo and induced-failure rollback; and live 401-before-parse / 413
  mutation-body limits. The optional visual-critique product is now integrated
  behind exact model/fixture identity, Apply/Keep, CAS and compensating restore,
  and live exact-model QA passed bounded preview, native Apply, CAS readback and
  compensating restore. Release workflow context and least privilege, the
  cross-runtime operation corpus, nav-derived EN/PT
  availability, OAuth source fairness, vision egress and TD harness process
  safety were hardened offline. Public/default whole-tool undo remains held for
  timeout/cancel/disconnect/reload/multi-request evidence, and public one-item
  undo/redo remains rejected because native labels cannot prevent same-label
  ABA.

- **Receipt-authorized operation boundary Wave 15 (source tree, unreleased).**
  The source tree now exposes token-required structured preview, one-request
  commit and capability-authorized receipt observation through the bridge and
  typed TD client, all outside `/api/exec` and the generic request undo wrapper.
  Wire receipts use a 256-bit `receipt_capability`, never the idempotency key as
  authority; journal retention refuses capacity before mutation and the
  TypeScript/Python/golden contracts are aligned. This is a guarded foundation,
  not a registered MCP tool or a broad undo default. The disposable Wave 15 TD
  instance never reached a listener, so controller response-loss, reload,
  concurrency and compensation remain **UNVERIFIED**. Generic stack undo/redo is
  permanently rejected; a future revert must be a separately approved,
  exact-state compensating operation with its own journal.

- **Authenticated operation closure Wave 16 (source tree, unreleased).** The
  isolated TD 099 build 2025.32820 process at PID 62916 passed the authenticated
  A0–A13 matrix with bridge exec disabled: exact one-request apply and receipt
  observation, native Undo/Redo, induced rollback, journal-v2 artist-drift
  refusal, response-loss/timeout/disconnect replay, same- and different-key
  concurrency, reload authority loss, the unchanged legacy per-REST wrapper,
  cleanup and final health. The direct receipt-authorized exact-state safe-
  revert core also passed revert/replay, native Undo/Redo of the compensation
  and zero-write drift refusal, but remains internal and unregistered. This does
  not make arbitrary multi-request tools atomic and does not change the default
  wrapper. Selection-to-component is a live **NO-GO** because Redo was not exact
  and induced rollback left an orphan redo item. The artist-facing agent turn is
  still **HOLD** pending an operation-specific Apply/Keep authority binding; no
  public tool or approval route was added.

#### TD-native residual follow-ups after Wave 16

- The guarded one-request operation route now has live response-loss, timeout,
  disconnect, reload, concurrency and artist-drift evidence on the exact tested
  build. Before registering an MCP orchestration tool, add an operation-specific
  Apply/Keep interaction that binds principal, exact plan and current authority;
  do not reuse an unrelated visual-parameter consent path. Never hold a native
  block across requests.
- The direct safe-revert core is live-proven only as an internal service. A
  public route/client/tool still requires separate approval, bounded recovery
  and authority-lifecycle design. Generic stack-based undo/redo remains rejected
  because repeated native labels cannot prevent same-label ABA.
- Arbitrary tools that issue multiple REST requests are still not one atomic MCP
  transaction. Keep the generic per-request wrapper as the default until a
  bounded one-request migration is designed and proved per tool.
- Migrate further destructive commands to the broker deliberately; emergency
  panic/blackout paths must remain non-blocking.
- OAuth CIMD interoperability and external multi-user/federated authorization,
  remote skill catalogs/installers and persistent workspace snapshot/restore
  remain separately scoped work. Selection-to-component is not a pending
  promotion: the current TD 2025.32820 collapse path is a recorded live NO-GO.
- Transient colour highlight needs compare-and-swap restoration under overlap
  and artist edits. Insert, TOX, package and custom-parameter routes still need
  headless and other-build validation before broader claims. The direct EXPORT
  primitive needs a public source-ownership, rollback and idempotency contract
  before promotion.
- Selection-to-component needs a documented identity-preserving native inverse
  or cancellation primitive before it can be reconsidered; the current collapse
  path did not reproduce an exact after state on Redo and left an orphan redo
  item after induced failure. Wave 10 exact placement and temporary artist
  workspaces still need the
  remaining live edge-case matrix plus headless and additional-build evidence
  before their guarantees can widen. Portable round-trip/help has the same
  platform evidence boundary.
- Bounded visual critique is integrated and live-proven on the exact approved
  model and TD 2025.32820, including preview, broker Apply, CAS readback and
  compensating restore. Other model identities, builds and actual headless TD
  remain explicit follow-up evidence rather than inferred compatibility.
- OAuth still needs a deployed public HTTPS/TLS fixture, real proxy overwrite
  rules and physical pointer interaction evidence. The live TD callback
  transport and hermetic trusted-proxy tests do not imply a production
  deployment.
- Workspace `open`, `restore` and `cancel` each have one same-key recovery attempt
  after an ambiguous initial response loss. Deterministic failures and a second
  ambiguous loss are never replayed; callers can still inspect `status`, and the
  lease remains authoritative meanwhile.

#### Local-copilot follow-ups (not implemented in Waves 4–5)

- Plan-preview-commit remains separately scoped; action-aware follow shipped in
  Wave 7, while colour highlight remains held by its restoration contract.
- Cross-host receipt correlation and signed/exportable audit envelopes remain
  separately scoped. Wave 5 receipts are local, redacted observability records,
  not replay logs or an undo mechanism.

### v0.13.0 — new tools, bridge routes, CLI parity

Published on **2026-07-07** (npm + GitHub release + `v0.13.0` tag). The 0.13.0
line shipped:

- **20 new tools (#128), live-validated on TD 099 build 2025.32820.** Layer 1:
  `create_step_repeat`, `create_pointer_reactive`, `create_interaction_zones`,
  `create_terrain`, `create_asemic_writing`, `create_sdf_text`,
  `controlled_disorder_grid`, `create_blob_trace`, `create_fixture_control`,
  `create_detection_reactive`, `create_geo_visualization`. Layer 2:
  `add_timecode_overlay`, `scaffold_vj_deck`, `create_synesthesia_unreal_osc`.
  Layer 3: `watch_parameter_changes`, `bundle_dependencies`,
  `check_operator_availability`. Library: `export_externalized_tree`. AI:
  `narrate_set`. Plus a `create_vertex_displacement_mat` MAT builder.
- **4 new first-class bridge REST routes + `param.changed` event (#128).**
  `POST /api/params/watch` / `DELETE` / `GET`, `POST /api/nodes/{path}/save`,
  `POST /api/duplicate`, `GET /api/optypes` — promoting `render_output` and
  `duplicate_network` off `/api/exec` (see G4). New event `param.changed` +
  `watch_service`; client methods `watchParameters` / `unwatchParameters` /
  `listParameterWatches`, `saveNode`, `duplicateNode`, `getOpTypes`, `getHealth`.
- **Full CLI tool parity — 44 new subcommands (#130).** All 21 vault tools plus
  `get_preview`, `watch_node`, `manage_packages`, `swap_operator`,
  `copilot_vision`, `auto_repair_loop`, `create_glsl_material`,
  `publish_recipe_bundle`, and others become `tdmcp-agent` subcommands; new
  `bundle-deps`, `export-external-tree`, `narrate-set`, `check-optypes`,
  `preview --inline [--watch]`, and a `doctor --json` alias.
- **Connectors Directory package migration (#129).** `.dxt`→`.mcpb` bundle,
  enriched + validated manifest, bundled `mcpb/icon.png`, and a field-by-field
  submission draft (submission-readiness for G6; acceptance is still external).
- **Recipe + install fixes.** `audio_reactive_basic`, `optical_flow_particles`,
  `audio_spectrum_bars` and `histogram_scope` fixed and live-cook-validated;
  recipe expression-mode (`expr`) support; drag-and-drop
  `tdmcp_bridge_package.tox` (`npm run build:bridge-tox`).

> **Docs follow-through (G5) — done.** The 20 new #128 tools now have EN + PT
> prompt-cookbook entries (20/20 each) and the new CLI-parity subcommands are
> documented in `docs/reference/cli.md`. See G5 below.

### v0.12.0 — safe mutations, previews and bridge hardening

Published on **2026-07-04** (npm + GitHub release + `v0.12.0` tag). The 0.12
line hardened the agent path around safer retries, cheaper inspection and
stronger local transport defaults:

- **Retry-safe mutations.** `create_td_node` and `create_node_chain` reuse
  matching existing operators instead of failing or auto-renaming; mutating
  bridge requests are wrapped in single TouchDesigner undo blocks.
- **Parameter and destructive-action guardrails.** Menu parameters now reject
  unknown entries explicitly, `delete_td_node` adds reversible bypass mode, and
  `set_parameter_expression` can reset or unbind values behind the exec gate.
- **Cheaper inspection.** `get_preview` adds JSON sample grids, pre-pulse
  capture and delayed capture jobs; `get_dat_content` pages large DATs;
  `get_parameter_menu` exposes live menu choices with bundled fallback data.
- **Layout and editor follow-through.** Shared layout moves docked DATs with
  their parent nodes, `rebuild_network` can auto-layout specs, and
  `focus_network_editor` frames generated operators in TouchDesigner's Network
  Editor.
- **Bridge and transport hardening.** Loopback peer-address enforcement,
  back-pressure shedding, Streamable HTTP `Origin`/`Content-Type` checks,
  optional bearer auth, an offline smoke harness, and portable contract export
  prepare the release for safer local automation.

### Wave 12 — v0.8.3 (live-show resilience + LLM token budget + CLI ergonomics) {#wave-12-v0-8-3}

Shipped as **v0.8.3** on top of v0.8.2. Tool surface grows
from 279 → **286**. Live-validated on TD 099 build 2025.32820 unless flagged
UNVERIFIED in CHANGELOG. Tagged `v0.8.3`; npm publish happens out-of-band via the
release workflow when `NPM_TOKEN` is set.

- **Live-show resilience (Layer 1).** `create_safety_blackout_chain` (panic
  blackout + fade-back recovery), `create_setlist_runner` (timed multi-track
  set with stage overrides), `create_show_failover` (watchdog + auto-failover
  between two render paths), and `create_pose_reactive` (MediaPipe pose →
  reactive particle / displacement) — the last one **closes ROADMAP A.6**
  (`create_pose_reactive` is no longer deferred).
- **Auto-repair loop (Layer 2).** `auto_repair_loop` runs `repair_network`
  on a cadence until errors clear or a budget hits.
- **LLM token budget (Layer 3 + resource).** `compact_graph_digest` emits a
  compact JSON digest of any subgraph; the matching MCP resource
  `tdmcp://digest/{path}` is registered in the `LLM_TOOLS` basic tier so a
  local copilot can hydrate context without re-running heavy inspection tools.
- **Vault.** `scaffold_recipe_from_network` exports a working subgraph as a
  draft recipe in the vault.
- **Two new first-class bridge REST endpoints** that survive
  `TDMCP_BRIDGE_ALLOW_EXEC=0`, continuing the G4 endpoint sweep:
  `POST /api/perform` (promotes `set_perform_mode` off exec) and
  `POST /api/param_modes/batch` (with new client `readParameterModesBatch`).
  Both tools keep their exec fallback.
- **CLI ergonomics.** `tdmcp init` — one-shot onboarding that stages the
  bridge, writes a client config (Claude / Cursor / Codex), seeds a profile
  and an optional bridge token, all with `--dry-run` + `--json`. `tdmcp ask`
  — non-interactive copilot turn: pass a prompt, get one answer back (with
  optional `--json` envelope, tool-call counts, `--read-only` / `--creative`
  tier and `--timeout` cap). See [CLI reference](/reference/cli).
- **`create_audio_reactive` extension.** Opt-in `transient_gate` +
  `sidechain_duck` modulation bus (4 new flags); defaults preserve the
  byte-identical container so existing prompts keep working.
- **Fixes since 0.8.2.** `create_histogram_scope` distribution curve
  (Pattern CHOP tx/tz synthesis); `create_control_panel` rgb 3-target
  binding; resilient MediaPipe DAT/mask lookup across `setup_face_tracking`
  / `setup_hand_tracking` / `setup_segmentation`.

### v0.8.2 — Stabilization patch: REST bridge expansion, recipe library, coverage push

v0.8.2 is the public tag for the 0.8 stabilization line. Same tool surface as
v0.8.1 (279 tools) — this release **does not add new tools**, it stabilizes the
existing surface ahead of v1.0:

- **Four new bridge REST endpoints** that survive `TDMCP_BRIDGE_ALLOW_EXEC=0`:
  `POST /api/transport` (timeline play/pause/seek/cue/rate),
  `GET /api/system` (gpu + monitors + performMode),
  `GET /api/projects/<path>/analysis` (project analysis port of the previously
  embedded Python script), and
  `GET /api/nodes/<path>/custom_params` (custom-par readout for COMPs).
- **Seven tools promoted REST-first** with `tryEndpoint(REST, exec-fallback)`:
  `snapshot_td_graph`, `control_timeline_transport`,
  `inspect_gpu_and_displays`, `analyze_project`, plus the custom-params slice of
  `serialize_network` and `inspect_component`, and a snapshot+rollback flow on
  `repair_network` (steps revert if `errors_after >= errors_before`).
- **`bridge_watch_build` shipped**: `tdmcp-agent watch-build` gates changed
  bridge Python with `py_compile` and reloads the running bridge automatically
  unless disabled.
- **Recipe library expansion**: +16 first-party recipes (15 → 31) covering the
  v0.7–v0.8 generators (kinetic text, decks, 3D scene, depth+displace,
  optical-flow particles, MediaPipe face overlay, scene timeline, GLSL plasma,
  pose skeleton standalone, particle system basic, feedback network basic,
  audio reactive basic, keyframe animation basic, video synth oscillator).
- **Tool API contract** reference page published at `/reference/tool-contract`
  documenting the v1.0 invariants (naming, schema, error handling, offline
  behaviour, result shape, deprecation).
- **Coverage gates raised**: `functions: 80 → 82` in `vitest.config.ts`;
  global Br now at 72%+. New test suites for `src/index.ts`, `src/cli/agent.ts`
  (wave-5 + wave-9), `src/cli/tui.ts`, `src/cli/doctor.ts`, `src/llm/server.ts`,
  `src/llm/client.ts`, `src/packages/cli.ts`, plus targeted regressions for
  `detect_pitch`, `repair_network` rollback, `create_envelope_follower` ducking
  topology, and a vault round-trip determinism suite. Three pre-existing flaky
  fs-heavy tests (`provenanceStamp`, `styleMemory`, `vaultRepoSync`) hardened.
- **Roadmap honesty pass**: Experimental / Out-of-scope / Planning archive
  reconciled (no shipped item lingering as backlog; gated items split into
  hardware / GPU / multimodal-LLM / paid-license buckets).
- **Bug fixes**: `detect_pitch` `notes` string now advertises the actual
  `DEFAULT_THRESHOLD = 0.0005` (was the stale `0.02`); `repair_network` no
  longer leaks `_snapshot` between invocations; `kinetic_text_audio_reactive`
  recipe now uses `audiofilterCHOP` (`audiobandeqCHOP` does not expose
  `loband`/`hiband`).

### v0.8.1 — v0.8 feature line, session profile and resilience patch

v0.8.1 is the public tag for the 0.8 release line. It includes the v0.8.0
npm-published feature expansion plus the post-merge resilience patch and the
missing public registration for `load_session_profile` /
`tdmcp://session/profile`. The generated Tools reference exposes **279 tools**:
the new AI-session tool, the generator and MediaPipe tools listed below,
dashboard-v2, N-channel `create_decks`, portable-tox README, Mermaid
`generate_readme`, the new MCP resources, and the AI Show Director.

- **Persistent AI session profile.** `load_session_profile` loads or initialises
  a local session snapshot (style, similar prior work, learned conventions and
  corpus notes), and `tdmcp://session/profile` exposes that snapshot as a JSON
  resource so an agent can hydrate context without re-running heavier vault
  tools every turn.
- **Release-resilience patch.** Vault writes, package state writes and staged
  package installs are atomic; HTTP transport listen failures reject cleanly and
  close event streams; failed Streamable HTTP initialization closes the per-
  session server; bridge GET retries now include transient 5xx API errors; and
  the layer-3 endpoint-first / exec-fallback policy is centralized in
  `tryEndpoint`.
- **Top-level package-manager discoverability.** `tdmcp --help` now expands the
  package-manager tree (`search`, `list`, `info`, `install`, `uninstall`,
  `doctor`, `packages path`) instead of hiding it behind one summary row, and
  `tdmcp packages --help` / `tdmcp completion <bash|zsh|fish>` include those
  package commands and common package flags.
- **Expanded `doctor --fix` repairs.** `tdmcp-agent doctor --fix` creates a
  missing configured `TDMCP_VAULT_PATH`, scaffolds the default profile directory,
  writes a missing bridge token to `.env` without printing the secret, can run
  `install-bridge --verify` behind a bounded repair hook, attempts a macOS
  Textport auto-install when the bridge still needs the manual `install.run()`
  step, and still prints suggestions for checks that need manual action.
- **Script-compatible run files.** `tdmcp-agent run` now forwards global
  `--no-color` into nested JSON/stdin steps, and individual run-file steps can
  set `"no_color": true`.
- **Bridge watch-build hot reload.** `tdmcp-agent watch-build` now treats saved
  changes under `td/` as runtime bridge edits: after typecheck/build pass, it
  runs `python -m py_compile` on changed `.py` files and calls `reload_bridge`.
  `--no-py-compile` and `--no-reload-bridge` provide opt-outs for build-only
  loops.
- **Offline MCP resource follow-through.** `tdmcp://glsl-snippets` exposes the
  vetted in-repo GLSL snippet catalog, `tdmcp://cheatsheets` adds compact
  workflow reminders with resource refs, and `tdmcp://learning/touchdesigner`
  pairs the existing `teach_touchdesigner` prompt with a curated KB-backed
  learning path.
- **N-channel `create_decks`.** `create_decks` now keeps the legacy A/B
  crossfader path intact while adding an explicit `decks[]` mode for 2-8 decks:
  per-deck source/gain chains, per-deck FX-send branches into an additive bus,
  an additive FX return into the master, a running Cross TOP program mix, and a
  hard-cut Switch TOP blended back into program with `cut_mix`.
- **Portable component docs.** `make_portable_tox` now writes a package
  `README.md` by default, documenting node inventory, custom parameters,
  inputs/outputs and external file references beside the `.tox` and manifest.
  `include_readme:false` keeps the old lean package shape.
- **Versioned recipe-bundle publishing.** New `publish_recipe_bundle` writes a
  local publish artifact folder: the recipe bundle JSON, a
  `tdmcp-recipe-publish.json` manifest with release version/recipe IDs, and a
  `tdmcp-checksums.json` SHA-256 manifest for repeatable handoff or later CI
  upload.
- **Deferred GPU-style generators (CPU/GLSL paths).** Four roadmap Milestone 2/4
  generators now ship as stock-TD networks — no CUDA, no external models:
  - `create_sdf_field` builds a programmable signed-distance-field raymarcher
    (CSG tree of sphere/box/torus with union/intersect/subtract + smooth blend)
    inside a single GLSL TOP, with live camera/step-count/intensity/colour
    controls.
  - `create_strange_attractor` runs a Script-CHOP-integrated ODE (Lorenz /
    Aizawa / Halvorsen) into a Script-SOP polyline + optional tube + Geometry /
    Camera / Light / Render pipeline for deterministic CPU geometry.
  - `create_optical_flow` builds a CPU optical-flow vector field from a video
    source out of stock TOPs (blur, monochrome, cache, composite subtract,
    optional edge, math, feedback+level), producing an RG-packed flow TOP usable
    as a drop-in modulator for displacement / particle chains.
  - `create_histogram_scope` adds the Milestone-2 histogram panel as a focused
    tool: GPU GLSL TOP bins → CHOP normalisation → `choptoSOP` → render TOP,
    luminance + optional per-channel RGB.
- **MediaPipe face + hand + segmentation (camera-only).** Three new one-shot
  adapters on the in-tree tracking engine:
  - `setup_face_tracking` loads the MediaPipe ENGINE and builds an adapter
    Script CHOP that emits a 468-sample (478 with iris) face-landmark CHOP
    (tx/ty/tz/confidence, centred on nose tip), ready for `bind_to_channel`
    and `create_data_visualization`.
  - `setup_hand_tracking` reuses the same engine and emits a canonical
    `max_hands×21`-landmark CHOP (tx/ty/tz/confidence/handedness),
    `coordinate_space='world'` recommended for gesture detection, ready for
    `bind_to_channel` or `create_pose_skeleton`.
  - `setup_segmentation` reuses the same engine, enables selfie-segmentation
    and publishes a clean alpha-mask Null TOP (+ optional pre-keyed
    `person_rgba` Null TOP), ready for `create_keyer`, `create_depth_silhouette`
    or any matte-consuming chain.
- **Inline preview pass (`get_inline_preview`).** New Layer-3 inspection tool
  returns a bounded TOP thumbnail (default 256×256, capped at 1024) together
  with resolution, pixel format, cook metadata and post-cook node errors in a
  single structured payload, so agents can verify a build without juggling
  `get_preview` + `get_td_node_errors`. **Closes the Milestone-4 inline preview
  pass.**
- **Front-of-house dashboard v2 (`create_stage_dashboard layout:"v2"`).**
  Opt-in dashboard layout adds a stereo VU pair, a BPM readout fed by an
  optional `tempo_channel` (e.g. a `detect_tempo` Null CHOP), an FPS / cook-time
  / frame overlay, a cue timeline strip driven by an optional `cue_times[]`
  array (pairs from `compose_cue_list`), and a sticky confirm-tap PANIC bar.
  `layout:"v1"` remains the default and is byte-for-byte unchanged.
  **Closes the Milestone-4 front-of-house dashboard pass.**
- **Stronger component READMEs (`generate_readme`).** New `include_mermaid:true`
  embeds a Mermaid flowchart of the operator graph in the "Data flow" section,
  and a `max_nodes` cap (default 200) truncates the Child inventory table with a
  one-line "_N more nodes not shown_" footer so large components produce
  scannable READMEs. Together with the existing `make_portable_tox` package
  README (license/manifest metadata + inventory), this **closes the Milestone-3
  trust & publish polish item**.

### v0.7.1 — Operator DX, local copilot & bridge-health patch

v0.7.1 is a patch release on top of v0.7.0. It keeps the public story focused on
operator reliability rather than introducing a new campaign label: the same
BEYOND / Ingest & Extend release line, now with a cleaner CLI, richer local
copilot context, more MCP resources, and a small read-only runtime diagnostic.

- **CLI/operator DX.** `tdmcp --help` prints usage without starting the MCP
  server; `tdmcp-agent run -` reads run files from stdin; `--continue-on-error`
  finishes a batch and returns the first failure; saved venue profiles can be
  listed/inspected with secrets redacted; `tdmcp-agent commands --json` and
  `tdmcp://commands` expose the command catalog; grouped help and
  `tdmcp-agent help <command>` make the CLI easier to scan.
- **Install, transport and watch ergonomics.** `tdmcp install-client --write`
  deep-merges and verifies Claude/Cursor/Codex config files; the bridge
  installer now has `--verify`, `--wait` and `--port` polling against
  `/api/info`; `tdmcp serve --http [--port]` starts loopback Streamable HTTP
  without changing the default stdio behavior; list commands can render
  table/CSV; the REPL has persistent history and Tab completion; and
  `tdmcp-agent watch` adds pretty output, event counts, heartbeats and debounced
  exec hooks.
- **Local copilot and resources.** `tdmcp://prompts` is generated from the real
  prompt registry, `tdmcp://recipes/search/{query}` searches recipes, and
  `tdmcp://cookbook` / `tdmcp://cookbook/{en|pt}` expose the prompt cookbook to
  MCP clients. The local copilot reads that prompt catalog, accepts
  `--read-only`, `--creative`, `--prompt`, `--profile` and `--config`, and can be
  tuned with `TDMCP_LLM_TIER`, `TDMCP_LLM_MAX_STEPS` and
  `TDMCP_LLM_TEMPERATURE`.
- **Bridge/runtime diagnostics.** `get_node_state_runtime` can opt into temporary
  Info CHOP sampling with `include_info_chop:true`; the bridge now serves
  `GET /api/health`; and **`watch_node`** adds a read-only short-window sampler
  for one operator's state, parameters and CHOP channels. Tool registry:
  **268 → 269**.
- **Packaging hygiene.** The release/bundle path no longer emits the deprecated
  `whatwg-encoding` chain or the staged production-install `mute-stream`
  `EBADENGINE` warning fixed after v0.7.0.

### v0.7.0 — BEYOND, Ingest & Extend, and operator DX foundation

v0.7.0 was one consolidated release train. It shipped the BEYOND campaign, the
Ingest & Extend waves, the Wave-3 smarter-assistance/library-publishing work, and
the `create_data_source_http_ws` hotfix documented in `CHANGELOG.md`.

#### BEYOND campaign

- **Wave 1 / v0.7.0 manifest — live-show foundation + all P0.** Shared
  setlist/scene schema, memory-note schema, server-sampling LLM fallback,
  `setlist_runner`, `create_scene_timeline`, `create_auto_montage`,
  `create_euclidean_sequencer`, `create_preset_morph`, `create_scheduler`,
  `create_glsl_material`, `auto_tag_library_asset`, `recall_similar_work`,
  `style_memory`, `lint_recipe_library`, plus `tdmcp panic` and
  `tdmcp dashboard`.
- **Wave 1.5 / folded into v0.7.0.** `import_setlist` and
  `export_setlist_to_vault` now share `SetlistSchema`; `scaffold_vault` seeds
  `Memory/README.md` and `Memory/style.md`; `save_recipe_to_vault` and
  `save_component_to_vault` can opt into deterministic auto-tagging.
- **Wave 2 — show automation + musical reactivity.** `compose_cue_list`,
  `create_prob_sequencer`, `create_automation_lane`, `scene_scheduler`,
  `create_chroma_reactive`, `create_transient_reactive`,
  `create_energy_structure`, `create_two_way_surface` and
  `create_phone_gesture`. The last two remain hardware-gated; the three
  musical-reactivity tools are experimental.
- **Wave 3 — library provenance + AI dispatch + scene resource.**
  `provenance_stamp`, `checksum_and_verify_pack`, `library_lineage_graph`,
  `morph_pack`, `learn_conventions`, `moodboard_to_system`,
  `audio_fingerprint_to_visual`, `score_build`, and the live
  `tdmcp://scene/{view}` resource.
- **Wave 4 — TD-depth authoring + DX accelerators.** `create_engine_comp`,
  `create_dmx_fixture_pipeline`, `scaffold_tool_generator`,
  `extend_data_source_fabric`, `build_chop_chain`, `author_script_operator`,
  `profile_cook_cost`, `control_timeline_transport`,
  `inspect_gpu_and_displays`, `macro_recorder`, `tdmcp-agent watch-build` and
  `tdmcp-agent soundcheck-monitor`.
- **Wave 5 — final BEYOND tail.** `curated_collection_pack`,
  `component_changelog_trail`, `merge_vaults`, `vault_repo_sync`,
  `variant_pack`, `learn_from_my_corpus`, `create_shared_memory_bridge`,
  `build_sop_geometry`, `sync_timecode`, `manage_component_storage`,
  `enhance_build`, `create_growth_system`, `run_macro_script`,
  `tdmcp-agent log-tail`, `record-fixtures`, `fanout`, `controller-bridge`,
  and `voice` / `llm-voice`.

#### Smarter assistance, library publishing & operator DX

The Wave-3 backlog of the Ingest & Extend campaign shipped in v0.7.0. Sub-batch A
delivered 3 pure-Node library/publishing tools, sub-batch B shipped 6 TD-required
AI/library tools, and sub-batch C closed the colour-finish polish while opening
the Milestone-4 operator DX lane.

Sub-batch A — pure-Node library/publishing:
- ✅ **`tag_and_search_library`** — faceted browse + tag editing over the vault
  library (Recipes/ + Components/ markdown notes). `op:list`/`op:search`/`op:tag`,
  preserves `'*'`-pinned user tags.
- ✅ **`version_library_asset`** — SemVer patch/minor/major bumps for a vault
  asset, recorded in a sidecar `<asset>.versions.json` and written back to the
  note's frontmatter `version`.
- ✅ **First canonical recipe pack — `generative_classics_pack`** — curated
  6-technique pack that emits an `import_recipe_bundle`-compatible bundle JSON.

Sub-batch B — TD-required (live-validated against TD 099 build 2025.32820):
- ✅ **`extract_palette`** — K-color palette from a TOP via deterministic
  k-means on its preview PNG.
- ✅ **`export_sop_to_svg`** — SOP polylines → SVG (pen-plotter / laser / print).
- ✅ **`swap_operator`** — change an op's TYPE in place, preserving wires +
  matching parameters (fail-forward).
- ✅ **`export_look_tox`** — save a COMP as a portable `.tox` into the vault
  with a Markdown sidecar for `browse_vault_library` / `tag_and_search_library`.
- ✅ **`tutorial_companion_pack`** — scaffold a teaching companion (lesson
  markdown + topology + previews + a `network_snapshot.json` documentary snapshot,
  explicitly not a RecipeSchema-installable recipe) into the vault.
- 🧪 **`copilot_vision`** — multimodal LLM query over a TOP preview.
  Live-tuning UNVERIFIED — no multimodal LLM endpoint configured in this
  session; mechanism (preview capture + `ctx.llm.complete()` contract) is
  covered by tests.

Sub-batch C — colour finish + authoring/DX:
- ✅ **`create_color_wheels`** — lift / gamma / gain RGB tints plus master
  offset and saturation controls.
- ✅ **`create_pop_geometry`** — POP-family-style procedural geometry rig:
  primitive → transform → subdivide → noise → material SOP chain, rendered
  through a Geometry COMP + Render TOP.
- ✅ **`tdmcp-agent config init`** — safe starter `.env` config writer for every
  `TDMCP_*` variable, with `--force` and `--dry-run`.
- ✅ **`elicit_missing_args`** — verified shipped in v0.7.0 after the Wave-3C
  audit; schema-driven elicitation has offline / no-server fallbacks.

#### Ingest & Extend

The Ingest & Extend campaign is folded into this release line. Waves 1-2 grew the
tool registry from 243 → 257, and Wave 3 completed the v0.7.0 release at 268
tools. The follow-up hotfix fixed the previously fatal HTTP-poll path before the
public v0.7.0 cut.

- **Wave 1 / v0.7.0 — ecosystem on-ramp + signature looks.**
  Shared `foundation_glsl_top_mapping` (preamble injection, ISF INPUTS →
  custom-page mapping) plus the importers and signature looks it unlocks:
  `import_shadertoy`, `import_isf_shader`, `create_fluid_sim`,
  `image_to_particles`, `create_dither`, `create_jfa_voronoi`.
- **Wave 2 / v0.7.0 — external inputs + color-finish + rehearsal (✅ included in v0.7.0).**
  `apply_lut` (OCIO / image-lookup / .cube fallback), `create_video_scopes`
  (waveform / RGB parade / vectorscope — histogram deferred, TD 099 lacks
  `histogramCHOP`), `setup_tdableton` (Palette probe + OSC synthetic fallback),
  `create_chop_recorder`, `create_flow_abstraction` (ETF→FDoG painterly),
  `create_npr_filter` (Kuwahara oil/pencil/watercolor — also three new
  `apply_post_processing` mode keys), and `post_passes_3d` (SSAO / SSR / DOF /
  motion-blur for 3D scenes — `apply_post_processing` now redirects 3D-only mode
  callers here with a friendly error).
- **`create_data_source_http_ws` hotfix** *(✅ fixed before v0.7.0).*
  The HTTP-poll path no longer raises `TypeError: must be real number, not str`;
  the dattoCHOP menu settings, selector table shape and live-readout custom
  parameters were corrected and live-validated against TD 099 build 2025.32820.

## ✅ Published releases

### v0.6.x — TouchDesigner depth & library fidelity

*A sharper, safer bridge plus two performance instruments.* Reads now report the
operator flags that explain the classic "why is it black?" (bypass / render /
display / lock), and the core editing operations — connect, parameter modes, DAT
text, logs — moved to **structured endpoints that keep working even with
raw-Python execution turned off**, the security-conscious venue setup.

- **`create_modulators`** — a tempo-locked bank of LFOs (sine / saw / noise) on
  one output; bind it to any parameter to make a network breathe in time.
- **`create_look_bank`** — capture, store and recall named "looks," with an
  instant snap or a quantized A↔B morph.
- **`generate_library_index`** + preview thumbnails — a Markdown contact-sheet of
  your saved recipes and components.
- **`get_td_node_flags`**, structured connect / disconnect / parameter / text /
  logs endpoints, and edge-triggered cook-error events for fast live recovery.

### v0.5.0 — Reusable components, agent-DX & live mixing

*The shift from generating visuals to packaging, documenting and cheaply
operating them.* Build a network → add knobs → script it → save it as a reusable
`.tox`.

- **Components:** `add_custom_parameters`, `scaffold_extension`, `analyze_project`,
  `generate_readme`.
- **Token-cheap editing:** `edit_dat_content`, `set_dat_content`,
  `batch_operations`, `manage_annotation`, a compact whole-network read, and
  `serialize_network` / `rebuild_network` (a diffable JSON round-trip).
- **Live mixing & content:** `create_transition`, `create_live_source`,
  `create_layer_stack`, `create_media_bin`, `create_keyer`, plus signature effects
  (`create_datamosh`, `create_displacement_warp`, `create_halftone`,
  `create_feedback_tunnel`, `create_text_3d`) and five new `apply_post_processing`
  effects.
- **One-shot reactivity:** `bind_audio_reactive`, `create_data_reactive`.
- **Library & packaging:** portable `.tox` bundles, checksummed recipe bundles,
  asset validation, and a local marketplace index.
- **11 new AI prompts** (fix a dead signal, recover a show mid-set, hands-free AI
  VJ, color story, setlist planner…) and a `tdmcp://prompts` catalog.
- **Use tdmcp from inside TouchDesigner** via dotsimulate's LOPs MCP Client.

### v0.4.0 — Signature 3D / GPU visuals & more creation

Fifteen tools, live-validated in TouchDesigner: `create_raymarch_scene`,
`create_particle_flock`, `create_point_cloud`, `create_pbr_scene`,
`create_cubemap_dome`, `detect_tempo`, `create_palette`, `create_led_mapper`,
`create_cue_sequencer`, `create_stage_dashboard`, `create_generative_audio`,
`scaffold_genre`, plus the `text_to_recipe` and `style_reference` prompts.
**Body & pose tracking** (MediaPipe) also landed around this time.

### v0.3.0 — The big release: reactivity, performance, 3D & AI

The largest single release — a scriptable CLI, musical reactivity, live-performance
instruments, advanced creation, a dimensional 3D/depth layer, assistant
intelligence, and robustness/export.

- **Musical reactivity:** `extract_audio_features`, `create_tempo_sync`,
  `bind_to_channel` (the link that actually wires a signal into a visual),
  `create_spectrum`, `detect_onsets`, `create_waveform`.
- **Live performance:** `manage_cue` (scenes + eased morph), `create_macro`,
  `randomize_controls`, `create_control_surface`, `create_phone_remote`,
  `create_autopilot` (beat-driven auto-VJ), `create_panic`, `create_clip_launcher`.
- **Stage I/O & sensors:** `create_motion_reactive` (the camera counterpart to
  audio), `create_multi_output` (multi-projector with soft edge-blending),
  `create_text_overlay`, `sync_external_clock`.
- **Advanced creation:** `create_3d_scene`, `create_video_player`,
  `create_layer_mixer`, `create_projection_mapping`, `create_keyframe_animation`,
  `create_simulation`, the signature effects (`create_strobe`,
  `create_kaleidoscope`, `create_glitch`, `create_kinetic_text`),
  `create_color_grade`, `create_shader_lib`, `create_video_synth`, `import_model`.
- **Dimensional (3D / depth / mapping):** `create_3d_audio_reactive`,
  `create_dome_output`, `create_mesh_warp`, `create_depth_displacement`,
  `create_gpu_particle_field`.
- **Intelligence:** `search_operators` over a 629-operator knowledge base,
  `document_network`, and AI prompts (recreate a reference image, plain-language
  tweaks, aesthetic critique, build a VJ set, fix a shader).
- **Robustness & export:** `render_output`, `record_movie`, `optimize_performance`,
  `diff_snapshots`, `manage_checkpoint`, a recipe library, `reload_bridge`, a full
  CLI, and a `doctor` diagnostic.
- **Obsidian vault integration** — bridge a folder of Markdown notes to
  TouchDesigner: recipes, setlists, shaders, presets and a dated show diary.
  *(See the caveat below — currently offline-tested.)*
- **Local LLM copilot** (`tdmcp chat`) — a browser chat driven by a local model
  (Ollama) for simple tasks, with no API key required.

### v0.3.1 — Easy install & privacy

The one-click Claude Desktop bundle (now `.mcpb`, the current Anthropic format)
and a privacy policy: tdmcp runs **entirely on your machine**, collects nothing,
and has no telemetry.

### v0.2.0 — Live control

The first step from static renders to playable instruments:
`create_control_panel`, `animate_parameter`, `manage_presets`,
`create_external_io` (OSC/MIDI in, DMX/Art-Net out, NDI/Syphon-Spout in) and
`manage_component` (save / load `.tox`). From here on, every generator arrives
with knobs.

---

## 🧪 Experimental & needs validation

These are usable in the latest public release, but they carry an honest caveat —
they need live tuning, specific hardware, or a final on-hardware check before
they're considered solid.

- **Live-music tuning** (offline-built, defaults need real music to graduate):
  `create_chroma_reactive`, `create_transient_reactive`,
  `create_energy_structure`. Schemas, network topology and unit tests are
  green; only the perceptual defaults remain experimental.
- **Hardware round-trip pending** (builder is offline-tested, only the live
  device exchange is unverified): `create_two_way_surface` (MIDI/OSC guards),
  `create_phone_gesture` (smartphone sensors).
- **Multimodal-LLM dependent**: `caption_top`, `copilot_vision`. Tool schema
  and prompt assembly are unit-tested; output quality is gated on a stable
  multimodal endpoint — see *Out of scope* below.
- **Rollback tuning** (offline-improvable): `repair_network` ships with offline
  unit tests; the snapshot/restore loop will get a dedicated regression test
  before it leaves experimental.
- **Obsidian vault tools** — fully unit-tested, but their live round-trip inside a
  running TouchDesigner hasn't been exercised end-to-end yet. The pure
  serialization↔deserialization round-trip is offline-improvable and queued.
- **Signal-detection tools**:
  - `detect_pitch` — known issue: default threshold can read near-zero on
    quiet inputs. A regression test pinning the default behaviour is queued;
    until then, pass an explicit `threshold` for reliable readings.
  - `detect_tempo` — BPM lock validated against synthetic clicks; live music
    tuning still required.
  - `create_envelope_follower` — sidechain routing topology is unit-tested;
    perceptual gate/duck timings need a real source.
- **`learn_control`** — interactive MIDI/OSC "learn"; schema/modes are
  offline-tested, the input-event stream depends on live hardware.
- **`create_pop_field`** — a first generator for TouchDesigner's GPU **POP**
  family, which is itself experimental upstream in this build; the render path
  is held pending live validation.
- **MIDI hardware tools** — `create_midi_note_reactive` and `create_midi_map`
  preview fine from a synthetic note source, but the real device paths need a
  controller to confirm.
- **External-clock sync** — `sync_external_clock` `mode='tap'` is stable
  (offline-tested, default). Modes `ableton_link` and `midi_clock` are
  hardware-gated; a manual-BPM fallback keeps the tool usable when no clock
  source is present.
- **v0.6.x bridge-routing regression check** — the seven v0.6.0 features were
  each validated live in TouchDesigner, but the full bridge reinstall plus live
  HTTP routing round-trip remains a recurring smoke check after bridge or
  installer changes.

---

## ⬜ Planned — the road to 1.0 {#planned}

With the v0.8 line published (and now public **v0.13.1** on top of it), the
deferred SDF, strange-attractor, optical-flow and
histogram-scope generators; MediaPipe face / hand / segmentation adapters; the
persistent `load_session_profile` (+ `tdmcp://session/profile` resource);
additional `doctor --fix` repairs; the `get_inline_preview` inspection tool;
the front-of-house dashboard v2 layout; and the stronger `generate_readme` /
`make_portable_tox` component-doc pass all shipped in the v0.8 release line.
The pre-Round-4 Planned list was empty (all v0.8.x queued items shipped); the
**2026-06-09 hype-scout** ([Round 4](#appendix-d-round4)) reopened it with a
trend-driven set of buildable wins. The remaining work toward a tagged 1.0
splits in two: **consolidation** (API stability, coverage, recipes, bridge
hardening, docs, one-click install) tracked in
[v1.0.0 — Consolidation](#v100-consolidation), **plus the small Round-4
quick-win wave** (force multipliers + the top-5 hand-to-pipeline items) listed
under Milestone 3 just below. Only items that still need a future code change
(not a hardware/service blocker) belong in this Planned section.
Hardware-, live-music-, multimodal-LLM- and GPU/CUDA-gated items have been
moved to **Out of scope (for now)** below. Version targets are a rough
sequence, **not a promise**. One additional design-stage slice is tracked here:
a Soundcraft Ui24R / mixer-aware expansion of AI-Controlled Party. It belongs in
Planned because it needs future code changes, but it is **not shipped** and
**not a live hardware claim**. The exhaustive, item-by-item backlog lives in the
[planning archive](#full-backlog).

### Creative RAG follow-ups (post-#76) {#planned-creative-rag}

The Creative RAG MVP (#75) and the post-MVP robustness wave (#76 — embedding
batching, `indexVersion` migration, Content-Type binary extension, Smithsonian
+ Wikimedia Commons + Europeana sources, optional `TDMCP_RAG_BACKEND=lancedb`)
are **Shipped** above. The remaining follow-ups are tracked here:

- **[P2 product]** `SourceSkippedError` — distinguish "no key" from "empty
  source" so a misconfigured key-gated source never tombstones real cards.
- **[Shipped]** Configurable multilingual embedding model (`bge-m3`) — env +
  docs + CI smoke (`creative-rag-multilingual-smoke` job). Default unchanged
  (`nomic-embed-text`); rebuild required when switching.
- **[P2 product]** `canonicalizeGuid` regression test pinning the rule that
  source URLs / ids never embed an API key (the lesson from the Europeana
  `wskey` strip).
- **[Shipped]** Optional RAG context injection in `tdmcp ask` (flag-
  gated; must not change tool tiers or confirmation gates). (#87, v0.6.0)
- **[Shipped]** MCP prompt `creative-inspiration` returning a curated
  mood-board payload (search + a handful of `tdmcp://creative/cards/*` URIs). (#88, v0.6.0)
- **[Shipped]** Opt-in MCP tool `apply_creative_card` (gated by
  `TDMCP_RAG_APPLY_CARD=1`) that routes a card's `tdmcpAffordances` to the
  right Layer 1/2 tool — closes the inspiration → execution loop without
  expanding the default tool surface. (#89, v0.6.0)
- **[Shipped]** `tdmcp doctor` coverage for RAG: Ollama reachable, embedding
  model pulled, `TDMCP_RAG_DATA_DIR` writable; surfaced in `--json` output. (#90, v0.6.0)
- **[Shipped]** Mandatory probe-live step for every new source PR (lesson from
  the Europeana key-leak and Rijksmuseum shape drift — mock-only tests missed
  both). (#91, v0.6.0)

### Milestone 3 — Round-4 quick-win wave · v0.8.x / v0.9.x {#milestone-3}

Pulled forward from [Round 4](#appendix-d-round4) — every item is S-effort,
sits on existing scaffolding, and ships before the AI-bridge wave so the
force multipliers are in place when those wrappers land.

**Force multipliers (do these first — D.0):**

- ✅ **FM-01 — `create_external_io` outbound modes** (`ndi_out`,
  `syphon_spout_out`) (shipped v0.9.0). Two KB-confirmed stock TOPs, additive
  to the existing `_TYPEMAP` literal. Unlocks every TD↔AI bridge below.
- ✅ **FM-02 — `dropExternalTox` helper** (shipped v0.9.0) for the canonical
  dotsimulate TOX-drop pattern (discover paths → drop into `baseCOMP` →
  validate custom pars → OSC-bind). Removes copy-paste between
  StreamDiffusion / ComfyUI / DepthAnything / LOPs / TDGS / MediaPipe
  wrappers.
- ✅ **FM-03 — Layer-2 `build_pop_chain`** generic POP chain builder over
  `NetworkBuilder` (shipped v0.9.0). Unblocks the 5 POP-combo Layer-1 tools.

**Top-5 ready-for-pipeline (D.1):**

- ✅ `create_pose_controlnet_driver` — OpenPose-color render TOP over the
  existing pose stack; no external TOX (Hype × Ease = 9). (shipped v0.9.0)
- ✅ `create_ascii_render` — character-grid TOP alongside `create_dither` /
  `create_halftone` (Hype × Ease = 9). (shipped v0.9.0)
- ✅ `create_phrase_locked_cue_engine` — extension to `createSyncExternalClock`
  that quantizes cues to Ableton bars/phrases. (shipped v0.9.0)
- ✅ `create_audio_glsl_uniforms` — Layer-2 helper that binds audio CHOPs as
  uniforms on `glslTOP`. (shipped v0.9.0)
- ⬜ `create_external_io` outbound — itself FM-01 above.

### Milestone 4 — Generative-AI bridge wave (gated on FM-01 + FM-02) · ✅ v0.9.0

The trend-dominant cluster from [Round 4 D.2](#appendix-d-round4) — wrappers
around components users install themselves; never bundled. All entries
*remain* GPU/CUDA-gated for the *bundled* path; this wave ships only the
**drive-installed-tox** and **cloud** deltas. **Shipped in v0.9.0** (hype-scout
Round 4, #63): all eight register, are unit-tested offline, and survive
`TDMCP_BRIDGE_ALLOW_EXEC=0`. Live GPU/component validation stays UNVERIFIED until
each is run against its installed component — the cloud `connect_daydream_cloud`
path is the one validatable without a local GPU.

- ✅ `setup_mediapipe_plugin` (torinmb canonical) — extension over the
  shipped face/hand/segmentation setup.
- ✅ `drive_streamdiffusion` (dotsimulate TOX wrapper).
- ✅ `create_depth_from_2d` (TDDepthAnything v2 wrapper; reopens the
  Round-3 EX placeholder).
- ✅ `connect_comfyui` (olegchomp/TDComfyUI or JiSenHua/ComfyUI-TD).
- ✅ `connect_daydream_cloud` (cloud path that skips the local GPU gate).
- ✅ `create_gaussian_splat_scene` (TDGS / POPs Gaussian-Splat v2026) —
  the top trend in the scout, four-surface unanimous H.
- ✅ `create_llm_chain` (dotsimulate LOPs).
- ✅ `create_ai_mirror` combo recipe (depends on the bridge above + FM-01).

### Milestone 5 — AI Show Director mixer scene arming · ⬜ Planned (design-stage)

Still fully ⬜ — no `arm_mixer_scene` tool exists yet; all five rows below stay
dry-run, manifest-gated and approval-gated before any live adapter is built.
Design status: `_workspace/ai-party-mixer/05_synthesis_design.md` and
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-04-ai-party-ui24r-scene-arming-design.md`
define the first safe slice.

| Item | Delivers | Status | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `arm_mixer_scene` contract | A new Show Director intent for operator-approved Soundcraft Ui24R show/snapshot/cue arming, separate from blocked `mixer_gain`, `pa_mute` and `audio_routing` effects. | ⬜ Planned | Must remain dry-run and approval-gated; valid targets come only from a trusted scene catalog. |
| Mixer scene catalog / manifest | Venue-side allowlist with stable scene IDs, Ui24R show/snapshot/cue refs, policy hash/checksum, allowed setlist sections, rollback target and safety notes. | ⬜ Planned | Any scene that may hide gain, PA mute, routing, patching, channel-strip, mute-group or phantom-power changes stays operator-only/manual. |
| Dry-run mixer adapter | Adapter interface and dry-run backend that consumes approved mixer-scene plans and returns `hardware_changed:false`. | ⬜ Planned | No Soundcraft, Companion, Node or TouchDesigner hardware client may be constructed in this slice. |
| Companion live backend spike | Bitfocus Companion backend for one bench-validated Ui24R scene mapped to one preconfigured button. | ⬜ Planned | Isolated bench validation required; `sent`/`acknowledged`/`confirmed` must be separate audit states. |
| Direct Node bridge research | Protocol proof for show/snapshot/cue recall against the target Ui24R firmware. | ⬜ Planned | No raw commands; no gain/mute/routing/channel operations; fixture tests before any live backend. |

### What's left for 1.0

With both the round-2 BEYOND backlog and the round-3 ingest-and-extend pass
fully landed in the v0.8 release line, **and Milestones 3-4 above shipped on
the v0.9 line**, the remaining work to 1.0 is **consolidation**. The measurable
gates live in [v1.0.0 — Consolidation](#v100-consolidation) below; every open
item should map to one of those gates rather than to a new entry here. The Ui24R
mixer-scene work remains a bounded AI Show Director extension and must ship
behind dry-run, manifest and bench-validation gates before any live adapter is
considered.

### Later / deferred

The P2 long tail (the full list is in the [planning archive](#full-backlog),
including the Round-4 D.5 aesthetic tools and the Round-4 D.4 hardware items
that move to "Out of scope") — plus everything already moved to **Out of
scope** just below.

---

## Out of scope (for now)

Being honest about the edges. These need hardware, a live music source, a
multimodal LLM endpoint, a specific GPU/OS, a paid license, or cut against
tdmcp's local-first design — so they're parked until they can be validated
properly:

- **Multimodal-LLM-gated:** live-tuning `caption_top` and `copilot_vision`
  (vision-capable transcripts, smarter copilot handoff) is parked until
  there's a stable multimodal LLM endpoint to validate the prompts/output
  against. (`repair_network` is **not** multimodal-gated — its remaining
  hardening is offline rollback-regression testing, tracked in the
  Experimental section above.)
- **Live-music-gated reactivity validation:** graduating the chroma /
  percussive-vs-tonal / song-structure detectors out of experimental requires
  validating defaults against real music sources in a live setting.
- **GPU / CUDA-bound:** real-time AI generation (StreamDiffusion / ComfyUI /
  DepthAnything) is kept only as a way to *drive an already-installed* component
  or as a cloud option — never bundled. GPU fluid simulation and any
  optical-flow particle path that depends on CUDA can't be validated on the
  current macOS dev machine and remain parked (the new stock-TOP
  `create_optical_flow` ships in main).
- **Hardware-bound:** depth cameras (Kinect / Azure / RealSense), SMPTE/LTC
  timecode genlock, and laser (ILDA) output. Where possible we prefer the lighter,
  camera-only paths (MediaPipe face/hand/body, stock-TOP optical flow). The
  Kinect wall harp is a concrete, synthetic-safe depth-camera tool, but portable
  live claims still depend on the actual room, projector, USB path and sensor
  validation.
- **Mixer/PA live control beyond scene arming:** autonomous PA control, mixer
  gain, PA mute, routing, patching, phantom power, mute groups and channel-strip
  edits remain out of scope for the AI path. The planned Ui24R work is limited
  to operator-approved show/snapshot/cue arming with a manifest and dry-run
  first.
- **Multi-machine / multi-instance:** managing several TouchDesigner processes and
  cross-machine genlock — parked until there's hardware to test against.
- **Paid TouchDesigner license:** the Engine COMP / TouchEngine headless path.
- **A hosted marketplace:** sharing stays **local-first** — TouchDesigner's
  Palette plus an Obsidian vault — matching tdmcp's no-server, runs-on-your-machine
  design.
- **Round-3 hardware add-ons:** Arduino/serial sensor input
  (`create_sensor_input`), TUIO/multitouch surfaces
  (`create_multitouch_surface`), and 2D LiDAR (`create_lidar_reactive`) —
  parked alongside the existing hardware-bound list until the hardware is on
  hand to validate.
- **Round-3 GPU/CUDA add-ons:** `create_depth_from_2d` (DepthAnything),
  `create_volumetric_fire` (NVIDIA Flow), and `drive_diffusion_tox` (cloud or
  drive-installed-tox only) — same gating as the existing GPU/CUDA bullet.
- **Round-3 multi-machine:** `create_machine_sync` (Touch In/Out genlock across
  machines) — same gating as the existing multi-machine bullet.
- **Round-3 paid-license:** the TouchEngine headless path beyond the shipped
  Engine COMP wrapper — same gating as the existing paid-license bullet.
- **Round-4 hardware add-ons:** iPhone TrueDepth/LiDAR via Record3D
  (`create_iphone_depth_source`, S012), Orbbec Femto Bolt
  (`create_femto_depth_silhouette`, S018, the post-Azure-Kinect successor),
  ZED 2i / OAK-D POE outdoor capture (`create_outdoor_depth_capture`, S038),
  2D LiDAR floor tracker (`create_lidar_floor_tracker`, S021), Nuitrack
  skeleton (`create_nuitrack_skeleton`, S023), ESP32 sensor bridge
  (`create_esp32_sensor_bridge`, S019) and capacitive pad grid
  (`create_capacitive_pad_grid`, S024) — same gating as the existing
  hardware-bound bullet. We prefer the light camera-only paths (MediaPipe,
  optical flow) until hardware is on hand to validate.
- **Round-4 GPU/CUDA add-ons:** `drive_streamdiffusion` (S001),
  `create_depth_from_2d` (S003), `connect_comfyui` (S004),
  `create_ai_mirror` combo (S017), `create_rd_diffusion_hybrid` (S048) and
  `create_sam_segmentation` (S046) — kept only as **drive-installed-tox** or
  **cloud** wrappers, never bundled. `connect_daydream_cloud` (S043) is the
  cloud delta and exits this gate.
- **Round-4 paid-license:** `connect_unreal_engine` (S014) — same gating as
  the existing TouchEngine bullet.

## v1.0.0 — Consolidation {#v100-consolidation}

With the feature surface at **378 tools** on HEAD (the generated Tools-reference
total), the road to 1.0 is
a set of **measurable consolidation gates**, not a new feature wave. Each gate
below states the current posture and what "done" looks like, using the same
legend as the rest of the page (✅ shipped / 🧪 in progress / ⬜ planned).

### G1 — Tool API stability · 🧪

The contract for a "tdmcp tool" is the `ToolContext` shape
(`src/tools/types.ts`) plus each tool's Zod `inputSchema`. Stability gate:

- ✅ The stability pin is written — [`docs/reference/API_STABILITY.md`](/reference/API_STABILITY)
  (with the companion [Tool API contract](/reference/tool-contract)) fixes the
  v1.0 tool contract, the additive-minor rule, and the deprecation policy
  (one-minor warn, next-minor remove).
- ⬜ One full minor release cycle (one tagged minor) with **no breaking change**
  to `ToolContext` or to any existing tool's `inputSchema` (additive optional
  fields are allowed; renames / removals / required-field additions are not).
  The 20 new #128 tools are **additive-only** — they don't break the contract —
  and per the pin doc the clock starts at the first tagged minor published after
  it landed, so this is the only open G1 item.

### G2 — Test coverage · 🧪

Coverage is tracked by `npm run test:coverage` + the
`npm run coverage:harness` ranking.

- ✅ **Suite-level CI coverage gate.** The `Coverage Gate` job in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm run test:coverage` and is a **required
  check** in `ci-success`, so a regression below the `vitest.config.ts`
  thresholds fails the build. The floors are ratcheted to the measured baseline
  (2026-07-07: statements 86 / branches 73 / functions 85 / lines 88) and only
  ever move up.
- ⬜ Reach the **+5 pp** stretch target (lines ≥ 91, branches ≥ 75) — currently
  at lines 88.85 / branches 73.36; raising the floors as coverage improves.
- ✅ Bridge tests (`npm run test:bridge`) and recipe validation
  (`npm run validate:recipes`) run green alongside the four PR gates.

### G3 — Recipe library depth · 🧪

The repo ships **60 validated recipes** under `recipes/`, all gated by
`RecipeSchema` and `npm run validate:recipes` (and cross-checked against the
knowledge base by `npm run lint:recipes`).

- ✅ **10 net-new recipes shipped** covering the v0.7–v0.8 generator wave —
  `raymarch_sphere_field` + `raymarch_infinite_tunnel` (SDF), `strange_attractor_lorenz`,
  `histogram_scope`, `ascii_render_post`, `dither_post`, `halftone_post`,
  `audio_glsl_uniforms`, `front_of_house_dashboard` (dashboard-v2), `sidechain_pump`.
  All validated against `RecipeSchema` with real optypes **and now live-cook-validated**
  (the `[Unreleased]` recipe fixes closed `histogram_scope` and verified the other
  nine cook with `errors:[]`).
- 🧪 **Orchestrator JSON twins — partial (60 recipes total).** The prior set of
  eight twins (glitch, kaleidoscope, slime simulation, spectrum, waveform,
  tempo-sync, layer-mixer crossfade, slit-scan) is joined by **10 new offline
  twins** of pure TOP/CHOP-network orchestrators: `color_grade_basic`,
  `transition_dissolve`, `text_overlay_lower_third`, `layer_stack_blend`,
  `strobe_flash`, `test_pattern_grid`, `datamosh_feedback_echo`, `chrome_blobs`,
  `displacement_warp_noise`, `luma_keyer` — all **live-cook-validated on TD 099
  build 2025.32820** (each applies with 0 node errors / 0 warnings; the
  displaceTOP `uvweight` token was corrected against the live op). Orchestrators whose
  behavior is callback/pulse/hardware/3D-asset-driven (e.g. `create_vector_lines`,
  `create_automation_lane`, `create_text_crawl`, `create_growth_system`,
  `create_pbr_scene`, `create_point_cloud`, `create_gaussian_splat_scene`,
  `create_fluid_sim`, the `import_*` and MediaPipe/Kinect/DMX tools) are not faithfully
  reproducible as static JSON offline and are deferred to post-live twin authoring.
  Also deferred: `create_keyer` chroma/rgb modes and `create_video_scopes`
  (need `chromakeyTOP`/`rgbkeyTOP`, not yet in the knowledge base — probe live
  first), `create_pixel_sort` (multi-pass GPU feedback — a static cook shows only
  the seed), and `create_color_wheels` (per-channel params absent from the KB).

### G4 — Bridge hardening · 🧪

The bridge already exposes first-class REST endpoints for the work that used
to round-trip through `/api/exec`: nodes CRUD, connect / disconnect, param
modes, DAT text, network errors / topology / performance, batch, preview, and
structured logs (see `src/td-client/touchDesignerClient.ts`). What's left:

- 🧪 Reduce remaining `executePythonScript` reliance. The **1:1-against-an-
  existing-endpoint sweep is complete**: every tool whose operation maps directly
  to a typed REST method already prefers it (15 tools — 9 via the canonical
  `tryEndpoint` helper + 6 with intentionally-manual conditional fallbacks),
  promoted across v0.8.1/0.8.2. Of the 183 exec callers, the remaining 168 are
  legitimate custom-Python / composite builds (create→wire→set→verify in one
  atomic pass) with **no typed REST equivalent**, or map only to the exec-gated
  `/method` route (no hardening value) — they correctly stay on exec, the
  intended escape hatch. **What's left is new-endpoint authoring**, not a rewire.
- 🧪 **#128 added 4 new first-class routes** — `POST /api/nodes/{path}/save`,
  `POST /api/duplicate`, `GET /api/optypes`, and
  `POST/DELETE/GET /api/params/watch` — promoting `render_output` and
  `duplicate_network` off exec (exactly the "new-endpoint authoring" this gate
  named). Remaining work is further new-endpoint authoring (e.g. batch
  create+write) via `tdmcp-bridge-endpoint`; it needs live TD to validate.
- ⬜ Keep `/api/exec` working when `TDMCP_BRIDGE_ALLOW_EXEC=0` is the venue
  policy: every Layer-1/Layer-2 tool must build with exec disabled (CI smoke).
- ✅ Resilience patch — atomic writes, clean HTTP listen failure, event-stream
  close — landed in v0.8.1.

### G5 — Docs completeness · 🧪

The Tools reference (`docs/reference/tools.md`) is auto-generated from the live
registry on every docs build. Guide pages (`docs/guide/*.md`) currently cover
install, first visual, body tracking, components, recipes, shader-park,
local-copilot, LOPs integration, AI-controlled party, prompt cookbook, FAQ,
troubleshooting and glossary.

- ⬜ Add per-arc guides for the v0.7/v0.8 work that doesn't yet have one:
  show timelines & setlists, dashboard-v2 / front-of-house, session profile
  & corpus learning, MediaPipe adapters, MCP resources (glsl-snippets /
  cheatsheets / learning).
- ✅ **The 20 new #128 tools and the CLI-parity subcommands are documented.**
  All 20 tools now have EN **and** PT prompt-cookbook entries (20/20 in each,
  parity holds); `docs/reference/cli.md` documents the new `tdmcp-agent`
  subcommands (`bundle-deps`, `export-external-tree`, `narrate-set`,
  `check-optypes`, `preview --inline [--watch]`, `doctor --json`) and the full
  MCP-tool parity + the 21 vault subcommands.
- ⬜ Every Layer-1 generator referenced in the cookbook has a one-paragraph
  "what it builds + when to reach for it" entry in the relevant guide.

### G6 — One-click install & Connectors Directory · 🧪

The `.mcpb` Claude Desktop bundle is built by
`npm run build:mcpb` and ships on every GitHub release; install docs cover the
one-click path.

- ✅ `.mcpb` bundle produced on tag.
- ✅ **Submission prep done (#129).** The `.dxt`→`.mcpb` migration, enriched +
  validated manifest, bundled icon (`mcpb/icon.png`), and a field-by-field
  submission draft are complete. What remains for this gate is external
  acceptance, not more prep.
- ✅ npm package publishing stays manual by default; CI auto-publish requires
  both `TDMCP_AUTO_NPM_PUBLISH=true` and `NPM_TOKEN`.
- ⬜ Anthropic Connectors Directory submission **accepted** — an external
  Anthropic decision, so this stays open until they accept (the submission
  harness — `tdmcp-submission` skill — drives prep and re-prep).
- ✅ Glama / awesome-touchdesigner listings cross-linked from `README.md`
  (`README.md` Links & community section).

> **Tool API contract reference.** The v1.0 invariants are documented in
> [`docs/reference/tool-contract.md`](./reference/tool-contract.md) (naming,
> input schema, error handling, offline behaviour, result shape, deprecation).
> G1's `API_STABILITY.md` pin will fold this page into the formal contract.

These passes are labelled in the order they happened (Round 0 → Round 4).
Round 4 (2026-06-09) is the first **trend-driven** pass — produced by the
`tdmcp-hype-scout` harness — and reopens the Planned list that Round 3 had
fully drained into v0.7/v0.8.

### Round 0 — 2026-05-28 (harvested into v0.5.0)

**78 distinct features** (93 raw; controls 23 · CLI 22 · AI 26 · TD-depth 22) — the
discovery that **fed v0.5.0 (Phases 13–15)**. Almost the entire backlog shipped
(Round 1 below confirms "Phases 13–15 / v0.5.0 harvested almost the entire
2026-05-28 backlog"), so its open remainder is carried transitively into Round 1;
it's recorded here for a complete lineage rather than reproduced row-by-row. Its
**Top-12 recommended-next — all ✅ shipped in v0.5.0 / 0.6.0:** `batch_operations`,
`bind_audio_reactive`, `create_transition`, `fix_reactivity` (prompt),
`create_live_source`, `read_parameter_modes`, `recover_show` (prompt),
`create_layer_stack`, `auto_vj_director` (prompt), `snapshot_td_graph` compact
mode, `create_media_bin`, `set_perform_mode`. The just-missed tier
(`create_keyer`, `edit_dat_content` / `set_dat_content`, config files + profiles,
`set_parameter_expression`, `create_datamosh` / `create_displacement_warp`) also
shipped; only `wrap_pop_family` (90 unreached GPU POP operators, L) remains open —
tracked as Round-1 `create_pop_geometry` and Round-3 `create_pop_fluid`.

### Round 1 — 2026-05-29

**77 candidates** (7 P0 · 38 P1 · 32 P2; 36 NEW · 31 EXTENSION · 10 ROADMAP). The
P0 set, control instruments, library thumbnail/index work, and several later
rows shipped in v0.6.0 / v0.7.x; the tables below keep only the remaining open
or partial work.

#### A.1 · Artist controls & creative tools

The only remaining Round-1 A.1 row targeted by this PR,
`create_decks` N-channel, shipped in the v0.8.1 release line above.

#### A.2 · Library, packaging & distribution

`bundle_dependencies` and `export_externalized_tree` shipped in v0.13.0 above,
leaving this open backlog. The remaining open rows:

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Impact | Conf | Priority | Novelty | Probe-first |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `expand_recipe_library` | First-party recipes for the new generators | M | Med | High | P2 | NEW (content) | live cook-check each |
| `recipe_from_live_network` | Faithful round-trip recipe capture via `serialize_network` | M | Med | Med | P2 | EXTENSION | GLSL-uniform round-trip |

#### A.3 · CLI & developer DX

`preview_inline_and_watch` (`preview --inline [--watch]`) shipped in v0.13.0
above and leaves this backlog. `show_mode_oneliner` is implemented in the
unreleased source tree as `tdmcp show <profile>`; Wave 14 live QA on TD
2025.32820 passed Perform entry, already-on behavior and fail-closed rollback.
Other builds and actual headless TD remain **UNVERIFIED**. The remaining open
rows:

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Impact | Conf | Priority | Novelty | Probe-first |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `error_exit_code_taxonomy` | Distinct exit codes (offline/TD-error/config) | S | Low | Med | P2 | NEW | error subclass survives |

`doctor_fix_autoexec`, `packages_cli_help_and_completion_parity` and
`no_color_flag_is_dead` shipped in v0.8.1 (vault/profile/token repairs +
`install-bridge --verify` + bounded macOS Textport automation; top-level CLI
completion / package parity; `tdmcp-agent run` `--no-color` propagation) and
are no longer tracked as open backlog.
`bridge_watch_build` **shipped in v0.8.2**: `tdmcp-agent watch-build` now gates
changed bridge Python with `py_compile` and reloads the running bridge
automatically unless disabled (`--no-py-compile` / `--no-reload-bridge` opt out).

#### A.4 · AI & LLM integration

The optional LLM-grounded extension to `plan_visual` is integrated and offline-
verified in the Wave 12 source tree, so it leaves the open backlog. It is
read-only, explicitly selected, bounded to one completion, validates grounded
identifiers and retains the deterministic planner as default and fallback. It
remains unreleased until a later release includes the Wave 12 work.

#### A.6 · Deferred (Round 1 — still gated / post-v0.7.x candidates)

Still open / partial after the v0.6.x–v0.8.x releases: `create_sdf_text`,
`create_vertex_displacement_mat`. ✅ `create_pose_reactive` **shipped in
Wave 12 / v0.8.3**, closing A.6's pose-reactive item. The earlier
deferrals (`create_gpu_fluid`, `create_optical_flow_particles`,
`control_diffusion` / `drive_streamdiffusion` / `connect_comfyui`,
`manage_td_process` / `switch_instance`, recipe/template marketplace) now live
in [Out of scope](#out-of-scope-for-now); hand / face / segmentation MediaPipe
modes shipped in v0.8.1; `create_strange_attractor` shipped earlier.

### Round 2 — "beyond the backlog" — 2026-05-30

**63 distinct candidates** (6 P0 · 35 P1 · 22 P2; 58 NEW · 5 EXTENSION · 0 ROADMAP),
every one deliberately beyond Round 1 and beyond what v0.6.0 shipped. The
BEYOND campaign shipped most of this round in v0.7.0, so the tables below keep
only the remaining open or partial follow-through.

#### B.1 · Artist controls & creative tools

All Round-2 artist-control rows shipped in v0.7.0 or are tracked in
[Experimental & needs validation](#experimental--needs-validation), so no open
table rows remain here.

#### B.2 · Library, packaging & distribution

The Round-2 library/provenance rows shipped in v0.7.0; open publishing polish now
lives under Milestone 3 above.

> `semantic_library_search` (raised here) was **merged into ai `recall_similar_work`** — same
> intent-retrieval capability; retrieval is owned by the AI surface.

#### B.3 · CLI & developer DX

`bridge_watch_build` shipped in v0.8.2 and is no longer tracked as open
backlog (see Round 1 A.3 above for the released wording).

#### B.4 · AI & LLM integration

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Impact | Conf | Priority | Novelty | Probe-first |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `voice_copilot_chat` follow-through | Browser Web-Speech push-to-talk in the copilot page | S | Med | Med | P2 | NEW | CLI alias exists; STT/Web Speech wiring still needs probe |

#### B.5 · TouchDesigner depth (bridge + operators)

`param_changed_event` is tracked once in
[Round 1 A.5](#a5-touchdesigner-depth-bridge--operators) as
`param_change_event`; no separate Round-2 entry.

#### B.6 · Cross-cutting (Round 2)

Value that spans surfaces (kept once above under its best-fit surface;
relationships explicit here). Most of these relationships are now real v0.7.0
architecture rather than speculative planning:

- **Time-based show automation** — `create_scheduler` (td-depth primitive) →
  `create_scene_timeline` (controls) ∥ `setlist_runner` (cli) ∥
  `compose_cue_list` (ai); all share **one** setlist/scene schema.
- **Run AI tools via the connected model** + a structured/image method on the LLM
  client — now used by `compose_cue_list`, `score_build`,
  `moodboard_to_system`, Round-1's `caption_top` and the new
  `copilot_vision` preview path.
- **"Do it my way" cluster** — `recall_similar_work` ⇄ `style_memory` ⇄
  `learn_from_my_corpus` ⇄ `learn_conventions` over one `Memory/` vault note
  schema.
- **Morph at two altitudes** — `create_preset_morph` (live instrument) ⇄
  `morph_pack` / `variant_pack` (saved assets).
- **Engine pipeline** — `create_engine_comp` (process) ⇄ a future "compile for
  Engine" bake on `make_portable_tox`.
- **Library keystone** — `auto_tag_library_asset` feeds
  `library_lineage_graph`, `recall_similar_work` and `lint_recipe_library`.

### Round 3 — external / community sources — 2026-05-30 {#appendix-c-round3}

**157 raw records → ~62 deduped candidates** (75 `EX` rows including sub-merges)
from four community sources — [alltd.org](https://www.alltd.org),
[awesome-touchdesigner](https://github.com/monkeymonk/awesome-touchdesigner)
(surveyed by two agents, creative ∥ integrations), and artist
[Anya Maryina](https://anyamaryina.gumroad.com) (studied for technique and
packaging only, never asset-copied). Distribution **6 P0 · ~30 P1 · ~39 P2**. The
new field versus the inward Rounds 0–2: **ecosystem ingestion**, **the missing
iconic looks**, and an **artist-publishing layer**. **Source codes:**
`aw-cre`/`aw-int` = the two awesome-touchdesigner agents · `alltd` · `anya`.

> ⚠️ **alltd.org returned HTTP 403** to direct fetch — its rows are
> search-summary-level; re-fetch alltd-only items via a browser before speccing.
> **Licensing discipline:** GPL-3.0 (TD-Flow-ABS, TDComponents, TDNeuron) + CC-BY
> (RayTK) = technique/idea only, no code copied; **Lygia not bundled**; Anya never
> cloned (highest attention: `generative_classics` recreates *techniques*, credits

#### C.8 · Reconciled out (already shipped / planned / gated / ignore)

Recorded for honesty: **exists-complete** — Shader Park (`create_shader_park`), the
full VJ-mixer stack (decks + layer-mixer + output + record), and Spout/NDI/Syphon
capture (`create_live_source`). **gated/planned** — optical-flow particles, the
Unreal/TouchEngine bridge (paid), StreamDiffusion/ComfyUI/DepthAnything bundling
(kept only as drive-installed-tox / cloud deltas), and Kinect/Azure depth-cams
(kept as the lighter optical-flow/MediaPipe path). **ignore** — TDNeuron / TF
Style-Transfer (GPL/Windows/legacy-heavy) and Cables.gl (not TD). Cross-cutting:
Round-3 `create_data_source` HTTP/WS folds into the v0.7.0 data-source fabric;
`create_fixture_control` builds on the shipped `create_dmx_fixture_pipeline`;
license-tier metadata hardens the v0.7.0 provenance work; and
`extract_palette` and `generative_classics_pack` are part of v0.7.0, relating to
the shipped `create_palette` / `generate_from_moodboard` lineage.

### Round 4 — hype trend scouting — 2026-06-09 {#appendix-d-round4}

> **Round 4 campaign complete: 5 waves, 28 features, shipped together in v0.9.0.**

**60 raw candidates → 38 deduped** from five external surfaces
(`community-showcase`, `tutorials`, `generative-ai`, `hardware-interactive`,
`vfx-aesthetics`) scouted in parallel by the `tdmcp-hype-scout` harness
(`.claude/skills/tdmcp-hype-scout/`). Each entry was evidence-cited (≥2 URLs
from 2025-2026) and feasibility-vetted against `src/tools/`, `src/knowledge/data/`,
`recipes/`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `src/td-client/`. Distribution after dedup:
**~16 H · ~22 M · 0 L hype** (heavy cross-surface confirmation of the AI-bridge
and POPs clusters). Profile used: default `Hype × Build-Ease` (max 9, min 1).
The curated per-surface tables (D.1–D.5 below) are the publishable summary;
the raw scout outputs and the full per-candidate vet notes / merge log live
under `_workspace/hype-scout/` locally (gitignored, like every prior round's
raw output). Source codes:
`comm` = community-showcase · `tut` = tutorials · `ai` = generative-ai ·
`hw` = hardware-interactive · `vfx` = vfx-aesthetics.

The new field versus the inward Rounds 0–2 and Round 3's static community pull:
**what TD artists are SHIPPING right now in 2025-2026** — finished work +
front-running tutorials, with a build-ease vet that prioritizes "the parts
already exist; we're missing the preset/binding" wins.

> **Distinct from Round 3.** Round 3 was an *ecosystem ingestion* pass over
> static catalogs (alltd, awesome-touchdesigner, anya). Round 4 is a *trend*
> pass over what's happening *now* — recent Patreon drops, new Daydream / LOPs /
> POPs releases, the StreamDiffusion v0.2.6 / DepthAnything v2 / SAM 2 / TDGS
> waves. Many tools recur because they're genuinely hyped across both ecosystem
> and trend angles; cross-referenced inline.

#### D.0 · Force multipliers (build first)

Foundational work that unlocks 3+ entries below. **All are S-effort** and sit on
existing scaffolding — these are the cheapest accelerators in the backlog.

| FM | Delivers | Eff | Unlocks | Status |
|----|----------|-----|---------|--------|
| **FM-01** | Outbound `ndi_out` / `syphon_spout_out` modes on `createExternalIo` — the universal "push a TOP out to StreamDiffusion / ComfyUI / MediaPipe-Spout-loopback / TouchEngine" plumbing. KB confirms both stock TOPs (`syphon_spout_out_top.json`, `ndi_out_top.json`). | S | S001, S004, S007, S014, S017 | ✅ shipped v0.9.0 |
| **FM-02** | `dropExternalTox` helper for the canonical dotsimulate TOX-drop pattern (discover candidate paths → drop into `baseCOMP` → validate expected custom pars → OSC-bind). | S | S001, S003, S004, S005, S008, S016, S028 | ✅ shipped v0.9.0 |
| **FM-03** | Layer-2 `build_pop_chain` — generic ordered POP chain wired by `NetworkBuilder`, with safe-default params per POP type. Unblocks 5 POP-combo Layer-1 tools without copy-pasting topology code. | M | S002, S006, S009, S010, S035 | ✅ shipped v0.9.0 |

All 5 score H×S=9 or M×S=6, sit on existing tdmcp scaffolding, and need no new
bridge endpoint. The AI bridges (StreamDiffusion / ComfyUI / DepthAnything
wrappers) outrank these on raw hype but are M-effort behind FM-01 + FM-02, so
they belong below.

#### D.6 · Reconciled cross-references

- **Gating preserved.** Realtime AI generation (S001 / S003 / S004), Hokuyo /
  ZED 2i / OAK-D / Orbbec / iPhone-LiDAR depth (S010 / S012 / S018 / S021 /
  S038), ESP32 / capacitive sensors (S019 / S024), Nuitrack (S023), and the
  Unreal/TouchEngine path (S014) continue to live under
  [Out of scope](#out-of-scope-for-now). They appear in Round 4 because the
  *drive-installed-tox*, *cloud*, or *light-camera-only* variants are now in
  active community use — but they remain gated for bundling and live-validation.
- **Round-3 overlaps.** S025 ↔ EX-71/72 (cookbook ASCII mention); S026 ↔
  shipped `create_time_echo`; S029 ↔ EX-25 feedback presets; S030 ↔ EX-24;
  S031 ↔ EX-21; S033 ↔ existing reaction-diffusion recipe; S037 ↔ EX-49;
  S041 ↔ EX-45. Where Round 3 and Round 4 disagree on priority, the Round-4
  vet (with citations from finished 2025-2026 work) wins for build sequencing.
- **Out — already shipped.** MediaPipe face/hand/body/segmentation (S028 base
  layer) shipped in v0.8.1 as `setup_face_tracking`, `setup_hand_tracking`,
  `setup_segmentation` — the Round-4 entry is an EXTENSION (canonical-plugin
  setup), not a duplicate.
- **Out — duplicate.** `import_blender_clipboard` (S045) is the same scope as
  `Blend2TD` (Round-3 reconciled-out, low priority); leave the Round-3 stance.
