# Deployment

How to ship `tdmcp` three ways: as a **Docker** container (HTTP
transport), as a **Claude Desktop Extension** (`.mcpb`, stdio), and to **npm**.

> **TouchDesigner is never containerized.** It always runs natively on the host
> with its Web Server DAT bridge listening on `127.0.0.1:9980` (see the repo
> `README.md` and `td/README.md` for the bridge setup). All deployment targets
> below are just different ways to run the *MCP server*, which then talks to
> that host-resident bridge over HTTP.

## 1. Docker / Docker Compose

In a container the server **must** use the HTTP transport. The default `stdio`
transport only works when the MCP client spawns the server as a local child
process; it cannot cross the container boundary. The image therefore defaults to
`TDMCP_TRANSPORT=http` on port `3939`, and reaches TouchDesigner on the host via
`host.docker.internal`. It binds `0.0.0.0` inside the container so Docker can
publish the port; non-container HTTP runs remain loopback-only by default.

### Compose (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This builds the `Dockerfile`, publishes `3939:3939`, and maps
`host.docker.internal` to the host gateway so the container can reach the
host-resident TouchDesigner bridge. Override the bridge location in the
`environment:` block of `docker-compose.yml` if TD listens elsewhere.

The image itself defaults to `TDMCP_TOOL_PROFILE=directory` and
`TDMCP_RAW_PYTHON=off` so hosted MCP registries can introspect a compact,
non-destructive tool surface. `docker-compose.yml` explicitly overrides those
values to `full` / `on` for the complete local runtime. Keep the compact defaults
for registry builds; set the variables explicitly when running the image by hand.

### Plain Docker

```bash
docker build -t tdmcp-server .
docker run --rm -p 3939:3939 \
  --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e TDMCP_TD_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -e TDMCP_TD_PORT=9980 \
  tdmcp-server
```

The MCP HTTP endpoint is then available on `http://localhost:3939`. Point an
HTTP-capable MCP client at it.

> **host.docker.internal notes.** On Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) this name
> resolves automatically. On Linux you need the `--add-host` flag (plain Docker)
> or the `extra_hosts` entry (Compose) shown above. If TouchDesigner runs on a
> *different* machine, set `TDMCP_TD_HOST` to that machine's IP instead.

## 2. Claude Desktop Extension (`.mcpb`)

Claude Desktop spawns the server locally, so the extension uses the **stdio**
transport (no `TDMCP_TRANSPORT` override needed). TouchDesigner still runs on the
same host; the extension exposes its host/port as user-configurable settings.

> `.mcpb` (MCP Bundle) is the Claude Desktop extension format tdmcp ships.

### Build the bundle

```bash
npm run build          # populate dist/ first
npm run build:mcpb     # (or: node scripts/build-mcpb.mjs)
```

`build-mcpb.mjs` uses the official packer when available and otherwise falls back
to a system `zip`. The upstream packer was renamed from `@anthropic-ai/dxt` to
`@anthropic-ai/mcpb`; the script prefers `npx @anthropic-ai/mcpb pack` and falls
back to the legacy `@anthropic-ai/dxt`, then `zip`. (The legacy packer predates
manifest spec 0.3 and rejects the `manifest_version` key, so install
`@anthropic-ai/mcpb` to use the official packer.) It writes `tdmcp.mcpb` to the
repo root and prints install instructions.

### Install

1. Open Claude Desktop → **Settings → Extensions**.
2. **Install from file** (or drag in) `tdmcp.mcpb`.
3. Set **TouchDesigner host/port** if they differ from the defaults
   (`127.0.0.1` : `9980`), then enable the extension.

The manifest lives at `mcpb/manifest.json`. It declares a `node` server with
`entry_point: dist/index.js` and surfaces `TDMCP_TD_HOST`, `TDMCP_TD_PORT`,
`TDMCP_BRIDGE_TOKEN`, `TDMCP_RAW_PYTHON`, and `TDMCP_TOOL_PROFILE` via
`user_config`, injected into the server env as `${user_config.*}`.

### MCPB, Smithery, and MCP registry configuration

All distribution manifests expose the eight profiles `full`, `safe`, `directory`,
`core`, `inspect`, `build`, `show`, and `library`, plus dynamic mode and the
120-tool / 256-KiB ordinary-selection limits. MCPB manifest v0.3 lists the profile
values in its setting description (that schema has no supported string-enum field)
and passes `TDMCP_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS`, `TDMCP_TOOL_MAX_ACTIVE`, and
`TDMCP_TOOL_METADATA_BUDGET_KB` through to the server. MCPB and Smithery keep the
package defaults `full` / dynamic `off` / 120 / 256.

The MCP registry manifest intentionally defaults to `directory`, raw Python `off`, and dynamic mode `off`, so its scanner receives the compact static surface. The `directory` inventory is static 15 / dynamic 22. A client that explicitly turns dynamic mode on receives the protected 22-tool union instead. This registry default is an introspection limitation, not a different package capability.

The fixed legacy full surface contains 497 tools. Dynamic full adds only
`discover_tools`, `select_toolset`, `get_active_toolset`, and `reset_toolset`, for
501 total, and exists only as a startup/reset compatibility state. It is not a
compact selection target. Dynamic presets do not include raw-code or destructive
tools; explicit risky selection still requires the exact name,
`include_risky: true`, and the existing approval/environment gates.

`client_refresh_required: true` is a hint rather than an acknowledgment. For a
client that does not refresh after `tools/list_changed`, choose a static profile
such as `build`, disable dynamic mode, and restart:

```toml
[mcp_servers.tdmcp.env]
TDMCP_TOOL_PROFILE = "build"
TDMCP_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS = "off"
```

To restore the legacy full behavior, use `full`, disable dynamic mode, and
restart:

```toml
[mcp_servers.tdmcp.env]
TDMCP_TOOL_PROFILE = "full"
TDMCP_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS = "off"
```

Neither recipe deletes code or changes per-tool approval settings.

## 3. Publish to npm

The package is public and published as the scoped npm package
`@dpantani/tdmcp`. The unscoped `tdmcp` name is blocked by npm's similarity
policy, so releases must stay on the scoped package.

```bash
npm run build
npm publish --access public
```

### Existing `package.json` release guards

- `prepublishOnly` guarantees a fresh build and a passing test suite run before
  anything is published.
- Scoped npm packages default to restricted access, so `publishConfig.access`
  and the manual command both keep the release public.
- The GitHub tag-release workflow publishes the `.mcpb` GitHub Release asset
  but leaves npm manual by default. It only auto-publishes npm when repository
  variable `TDMCP_AUTO_NPM_PUBLISH=true` and `NPM_TOKEN` are both configured.
