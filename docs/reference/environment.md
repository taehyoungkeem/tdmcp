# Environment variables

Configuration can come from environment variables or from an optional JSON config
file. Environment variables win over file values, so CI, Docker and MCP-client
config stay simple. Every variable is optional and has a sensible default.

## Server

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TDMCP_TD_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | TouchDesigner bridge host. |
| `TDMCP_TD_PORT` | `9980` | Web Server DAT port. |
| `TDMCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | MCP transport: `stdio` (default) or `http` (Streamable HTTP). |
| `TDMCP_HTTP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind host for the HTTP transport. Keep loopback for local runs; the Docker image explicitly uses `0.0.0.0` so its published port is reachable. |
| `TDMCP_HTTP_PORT` | `3939` | Port for the HTTP transport (when `TDMCP_TRANSPORT=http`). |
| `TDMCP_HTTP_AUTH_MODE` | `auto` | HTTP authentication: `auto`, `none`, `static`, `oauth`, or explicit migration mode `hybrid`. `auto` preserves compatibility by selecting `static` only when `TDMCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set; it never enables OAuth implicitly. Invalid combinations fail startup. See [OAuth, PKCE & TD consent](/guide/oauth-pkce). |
| `TDMCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Legacy pre-shared bearer for `static` or `hybrid` HTTP auth. This is not an OAuth token and is separate from `TDMCP_BRIDGE_TOKEN`. Pure `oauth` mode refuses it rather than silently downgrading. |
| `TDMCP_HTTP_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `1048576` | Maximum buffered MCP JSON request body, clamped to `1024..4194304`. OAuth registration and SDK token routes also apply smaller/default parser limits and rate/cap guards. |
| `TDMCP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | _(unset)_ | Required canonical OAuth issuer origin and resource base. Public deployments require HTTPS at a trusted same-host reverse proxy while Node remains bound to numeric loopback. Development HTTP requires explicit numeric loopback plus `TDMCP_OAUTH_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOOPBACK=1`; paths, credentials, query, fragments, wildcards and `localhost` are refused. |
| `TDMCP_OAUTH_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOOPBACK` | `false` | Development-only opt-in for plain HTTP on `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`. The HTTP bind must also be numeric loopback, never `localhost` or wildcard. |
| `TDMCP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_ORIGINS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated exact HTTPS origins allowed for non-loopback public-client callbacks. Wildcards and origins with path/query/fragment are refused. Numeric loopback callbacks use their registered path and may vary only by port. |
| `TDMCP_OAUTH_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated numeric IP addresses for the bounded same-host proxy chain. Forwarding headers are rejected unless the socket peer is pinned here and the canonical host/protocol/port match exactly; maximum 8 unique hops. |
| `TDMCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR` | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/tdmcp/oauth` or `~/.local/state/tdmcp/oauth` | Absolute owner-private directory for public client metadata, token HMAC key and digest-only token records. Symlinks, unsafe permissions or corrupt state fail startup. |
| `TDMCP_OAUTH_ACCESS_TTL_SECONDS` | `900` | OAuth access-token lifetime, clamped to `60..3600`. |
| `TDMCP_OAUTH_REFRESH_TTL_SECONDS` | `2592000` | Rotating refresh-token lifetime, clamped to `3600..7776000`. Replay revokes the refresh family. |
| `TDMCP_OAUTH_CONSENT_TTL_SECONDS` | `60` | TD-native Allow/Deny transaction lifetime, clamped to `5..120`; every unsafe terminal path resolves to Deny. |
| `TDMCP_EVENTS` | `on` | Subscribe to TD WebSocket events and forward them as MCP logging notifications (`on`/`off`). Events are disabled automatically when `TDMCP_BRIDGE_TOKEN` is set until the bridge exposes an authenticated WebSocket handshake. |
| `TDMCP_RAW_PYTHON` | `on` | Whether to expose client-authored raw-Python tools, including persistent Script callbacks. Set to `off` to lock them out for restricted setups. This removes only client-authored-code tools — many higher-level tools still send their own *templated* Python to the bridge, so `off` is **not** "no code runs in TD". The bridge keeps arbitrary-code endpoints disabled unless `TDMCP_BRIDGE_ALLOW_EXEC=1` is explicitly set; a token authenticates but does not authorize exec by itself. |
| `TDMCP_TOOL_PROFILE` | `full` | Tool exposure profile: `full`, `safe`, `directory`, `core`, `inspect`, `build`, `show`, or `library`. `full` preserves the complete legacy surface; `safe` hides destructive/raw-code tools; `directory` is the compact registry surface; the remaining profiles are task-oriented compact surfaces. |
| `TDMCP_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS` | `off` | Enables the four session-local discovery/selection controls when set to `on`. The package default stays static for existing clients. |
| `TDMCP_TOOL_MAX_ACTIVE` | `120` | Maximum active tools in an ordinary dynamic selection (`1..512`). Startup/reset compatibility states for a session that began in `full` or `safe` are exempt. |
| `TDMCP_TOOL_METADATA_BUDGET_KB` | `256` | Maximum serialized metadata for an ordinary dynamic selection, in KiB (`1..4096`). The same legacy startup/reset exemption applies. |
| `TDMCP_BRIDGE_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Optional shared bearer token. When set, the server sends it and the bridge requires it — set the **same** value in TouchDesigner's environment to turn auth on. |
| `TDMCP_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error` / `silent` (logged to stderr). |
| `TDMCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Per-request timeout to the bridge, in milliseconds. |
| `TDMCP_CONFIG_FILE` | _(unset)_ | Optional JSON config file. Keys match the internal config names (`tdHost`, `tdPort`, `requestTimeoutMs`, etc.). |
| `TDMCP_PROFILE` | _(unset)_ | Optional profile name inside the selected config file (`profiles.<name>`), whether that file is set with `TDMCP_CONFIG_FILE` or found through the default search paths. File base values load first, profile values override them, env vars override both. |
| `TDMCP_VAULT_PATH` | _(unset)_ | Absolute path to an Obsidian vault (a folder of Markdown notes). Enables the [vault tools](/reference/tools#obsidian-vault); a leading `~/` is expanded. Leave unset to disable them. |

## Dynamic toolset behavior and recovery

The package defaults are `full` / dynamic `off` / 120 active tools / 256 KiB.
Static `full` contains the complete 507-tool surface; dynamic `full` contains those
tools plus `discover_tools`, `select_toolset`, `get_active_toolset`, and
`reset_toolset`, for 511 total. The `directory` inventory is static 16 / dynamic 23. Dynamic `full` exists only for startup/reset compatibility and cannot be selected from a compact session.
With `TDMCP_RAG_APPLY_CARD=1`, the opt-in `apply_creative_card` contract raises
`full` to static 508 / dynamic 512 and `safe` to 465 / 469; `core` and
`directory` remain unchanged.

Every `createTdmcpServer` call owns one manager. The existing HTTP server factory
creates a separate server and manager for every MCP session. A transition follows
`discover -> validate -> lifecycle batch -> one tools/list_changed`, while the
protected core stays active. Presets are non-risky; raw-code or destructive tools
require an exact explicit selection, risky opt-in, and all existing approval and
environment gates. `TDMCP_RAW_PYTHON=off` always wins.

`client_refresh_required: true` is a refresh hint, not an acknowledgment that the
client updated its UI. If a client does not refresh, choose a fixed profile such
as `build`, disable dynamic mode, and restart:

```toml
[mcp_servers.tdmcp.env]
TDMCP_TOOL_PROFILE = "build"
TDMCP_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS = "off"
```

To restore the legacy behavior, select `full`, disable dynamic mode, and restart:

```toml
[mcp_servers.tdmcp.env]
TDMCP_TOOL_PROFILE = "full"
TDMCP_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS = "off"
```

Neither recipe deletes code or changes per-tool approval settings.

## Local copilot (`tdmcp chat`)

These configure the [local LLM copilot](/reference/cli#local-copilot-tdmcp-chat).

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TDMCP_LLM_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` | OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint. Defaults to local Ollama; point it at LM Studio, a cloud GPU or a paid API. |
| `TDMCP_LLM_MODEL` | `qwen2.5:3b` | Model id the copilot requests (must be pulled in the backend, e.g. `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`). Bump to `qwen2.5:7b` for more headroom. |
| `TDMCP_LLM_API_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Optional bearer token for the LLM endpoint (ignored by local Ollama; needed for paid/cloud APIs). |
| `TDMCP_LLM_TIER` | `standard` | Default chat tool tier: `standard`, `safe` (read-only), or `creative` (adds curated generators). The browser toggles can still override it per turn. |
| `TDMCP_LLM_MAX_STEPS` | `8` | Maximum model/tool loop iterations for one local copilot turn. Values are clamped to `1..32`. |
| `TDMCP_LLM_TEMPERATURE` | `0.4` | Sampling temperature sent to the OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint. Values are clamped to `0..2`. |
| `TDMCP_LLM_CALIBRATION_MODE` | `recommend` | Calibration policy for local copilot surfaces. `recommend` preserves compatibility; `enforce` requires a fresh exact cached decision and otherwise caps to `safe`. |
| `TDMCP_LLM_CALIBRATION_CACHE` | `~/.cache/tdmcp/copilot-calibration-v1.json` | Absolute owner-controlled calibration cache path. The manifest contains bounded synthetic evidence and redacted endpoint identity, never project content or API keys. |
| `TDMCP_LLM_CALIBRATION_TTL_MS` | `604800000` | Cache lifetime in milliseconds (7 days by default; clamped to `1..2592000000`). |
| `TDMCP_PROJECT_ROOT` | saved `.toe` folder when available | Absolute project root used for `.tdmcp/agent-brief.json`. Explicit tool input wins; cwd is never a fallback. |
| `TDMCP_COPILOT_RECEIPTS` | `off` | Set exactly to `persist` to retain redacted, bounded built-in-copilot receipts. Perform mode, emergencies and per-turn `noPersist` still skip writes. |
| `TDMCP_COPILOT_RECEIPTS_PATH` | `~/.tdmcp/session-receipts.json` | Optional absolute owner-controlled receipt-store path. Relative paths are rejected. |
| `TDMCP_CHAT_PORT` | `4141` | Loopback port the `tdmcp chat` web UI binds to. |

## Telegram copilot (`tdmcp telegram`)

These configure the [Telegram copilot](/reference/cli#telegram-copilot). It uses
Telegram Bot API long polling, so no public webhook or inbound port is required.
Messages are accepted only from configured allowlists.

For local setup, prefer `tdmcp telegram setup`: it validates the BotFather token
and writes the matching config keys to `~/.config/tdmcp/config.json` or the file
selected with `--config`. The environment variables below remain useful for
temporary shells, process managers and CI-style runs.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TDMCP_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Telegram bot token from BotFather. Required for `tdmcp telegram`; redacted in config output. |
| `TDMCP_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHATS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated Telegram chat ids allowed to reach the local copilot. At least this or `TDMCP_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` must be set. |
| `TDMCP_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` | _(empty)_ | Optional comma-separated Telegram user ids. When set, the user id must match in addition to any configured chat allowlist. |
| `TDMCP_TELEGRAM_DEFAULT_TIER` | `safe` | Default Telegram tool tier: `safe`, `standard`, or `creative`. Non-safe prompts still require `/approve`. |
| `TDMCP_TELEGRAM_POLL_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `30` | Telegram `getUpdates` long-poll timeout, validated to `1..60` seconds by the config schema. |
| `TDMCP_TELEGRAM_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT_MS` | `60000` | Expiry for a staged non-safe prompt awaiting `/approve`. |

## AI Party ShowIntent eval and rehearsal POC

These variables configure the local-model evaluation and optional improvement
pipeline under `training/showintent/`, plus the local Live Nervous System
rehearsal POC used by `npm run ai-party:*`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LLM_MODE` | `ollama` | Runtime mode label for the AI Party POC. The current eval harness targets Ollama. |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` | Ollama base URL used by `npm run ai-party:llm-eval`, `npm run ai-party:llm-baseline` and the optional Live Nervous System parser. |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `qwen2.5:3b` for eval, unset for the live POC | Ollama model id. The live dashboard uses deterministic fallback parsing when this is unset or unavailable. Use an improved model only after it beats the baseline without weakening safety metrics. |
| `TDMCP_AI_PARTY_LLM_MODEL` | `showintent-party:local` | Model id used by `tdmcp-agent ai-party --llm` when `--llm-model` / `OLLAMA_MODEL` are not set. This keeps the ShowIntent-only model separate from the general `tdmcp chat` model. |
| `LLM_EVAL_STRICT` | `false` | Set to `true` to make eval fail when demo-ready hard targets are not met. |
| `LLM_SCHEMA_VERSION` | `showintent.v1` | Schema/version label to record alongside reports and POC configuration. |
| `TD_BRIDGE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:9980` | TouchDesigner bridge URL used by `npm run ai-party:td-build` and dashboard TD preview checks. |
| `TD_BRIDGE_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Optional bridge bearer token for the Live Nervous System TD client. |
| `POC_DASHBOARD_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host for the local AI Party dashboard/backend. |
| `POC_DASHBOARD_PORT` | `8787` | Port for the local AI Party dashboard/backend. |
| `POC_EVENT_LOG_PATH` | `./data/ai-party-poc-events.jsonl` | JSONL event log for operator commands, policy decisions, approvals, dispatch results and health changes. |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Telegram bot token for `npm run ai-party:telegram`. This is separate from the general `tdmcp telegram` copilot variables. |
| `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated chat allowlist required before the AI Party Telegram polling loop processes messages. |
| `TELEGRAM_POLLING_ENABLED` | `false` | Enables AI Party Telegram long polling; `npm run ai-party:telegram` turns polling on for that process. |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` | _(unset)_ | Reserved for deployed webhook work; local rehearsal uses long polling. |
| `HARDWARE_ENABLED` | `false` | Future-adapter gate for physical-effect dispatch. Leave false for local rehearsal. |
| `DMX_LIVE_ENABLED` | `false` | Future-adapter gate for DMX/live physical dispatch. Leave false unless a venue-safe adapter and kill path have been validated. |

## TouchDesigner side

Set these in **TouchDesigner's** environment (not the server's) for defense in
depth — they are enforced bridge-side, even for direct network callers. See
[Security](/reference/architecture#security).

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TDMCP_BRIDGE_ALLOW_LAN` | _(unset)_ | Bridge address scope. The bridge is loopback-only by default and refuses off-host (non-loopback) peers immediately (HTTP `403`), before routing/auth. Set to `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` in TouchDesigner's environment to allow LAN peers; pair it with `TDMCP_BRIDGE_TOKEN`. |
| `TDMCP_BRIDGE_ALLOW_EXEC` | _(unset)_ | Optional bridge-side opt-in. Set to `1`/`true`/`on` in TouchDesigner's environment to allow arbitrary-code endpoints (`/api/exec`, node `method`) when no bridge token is configured. Leave unset for the safer default; structured endpoints keep working. |
| `TDMCP_BRIDGE_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Shared bearer token; must match the server's value to authorize requests. |
| `TDMCP_EDITOR_FOLLOW_ENABLED` | `1` | Set to `0`/`false`/`off` to suppress action-aware Network Editor follow jobs without changing MCP tool exposure. Suppression is typed and does not move the UI. |
| `TDMCP_TOX_PORTABLE_ENABLED` | build-aware | When unset, portable export is enabled only on the live-proven 2025.32820 build. Set false to disable it; set true only after separately validating the current TD build's DAT/external-TOX snapshot and restoration behavior. |
